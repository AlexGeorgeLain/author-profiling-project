I normally don't stay at courtyards as I have found most had been pretty basic and beat up. Much to my surprise, this property was quite nice. My room had two very comfortable queen size beds, a sitting area and a decent size, very clean bath.Best bang for the buck I have received in NYC, including some of the posh places like the Ritz and Four Seasons. Outside of the room there were not alot of ammenities but then it's NYC, outside the city is full of them. Worth the stay.
