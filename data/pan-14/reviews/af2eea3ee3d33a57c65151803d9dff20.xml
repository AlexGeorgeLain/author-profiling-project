It is an incredible hotel. The staff was great and the breakfast awesome but what I really loved was the room. It was a good size room with two queen beds (seem like all there is these days are two doubles) and a huge flat screen TV. I loved the bathroom too, it was nice. Also the alarm clock is an iPod player. Another reason we keep coming back is for the location. If you are going to Seahawk's or Mariner's game you have to stay here!! There is no taxi, bus, or driving required. It's not even two blocks away and surrounded by great restaurants.

We recommend walking down a couple blocks and visiting the Parrot Club, which is amazing. The room was fine, nothing too extravagant, but still clean and nice. Keep your windows shut at night though, the nightlife is really loud. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. We stayed one night before traveling home and it was a perfect hotel for the end of our trip.
