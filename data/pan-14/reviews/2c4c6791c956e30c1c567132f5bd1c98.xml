My wife and I have just spent 2 nights at the Casablanca Hotel (25 - 27 April).From the moment we arrived, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.It's a small hotel (43 rooms) and the bedrooms and lounge area are nicely decorated.Complimentary coffee and snacks are available all day. Right next to Times Square, it's a great location. Don't miss it!
