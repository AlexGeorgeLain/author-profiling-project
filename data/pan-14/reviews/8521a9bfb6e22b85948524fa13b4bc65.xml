I checked at least 3 times (two in December) to ensure that I was on the list for an upgrade. I have been a Hilton Diamond Member for over 4 years and have a continuance until April 2009.Arrived on December 25th to a sold out hotel. They did have a king size room reserved in the Tapia Tower overlooking the garden pool and over the band area of the cocktail lounge. The band played from 7:30 p.m. until 11:00 p.m. I asked to be notified of any potential upgrades over the 6 day stay and was told by the manager Kim that all rooms were pre-assigned.They did provide a complimentary continental breakfast coupon. I was advised that all executive floors are closed and there will no longer be an executive lounge. In other words this resort is not seeking or rewarding business members.Imagine my surprise re upgrades when on December 31st I was referred to the refreshment room in the Tapia Towers to find this room was a suite overlooking the ocean. Why use a suite for a quick change room prior to travel?Food and beverage was expensive. Room service was good. This hotel is for tourist groups and families. I do not recommend it for business or single person travel.
