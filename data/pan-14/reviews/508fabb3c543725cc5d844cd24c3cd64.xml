Sorry it took me so long to write a review ( we stayed August 8 on...) My sister and I were treated like Princesses. We loved everything about Jay's. The location is perfect, close to the Metro, Eiffel, Champs yet a very non-touristy residential street. Yes, we would stay there again and my niece hopes your engagement, Garret, might not happen ! Just kidding... :-) Loved the rooms, HUGE and bathrooms, HUGE (great Clarins products, too) and the special touches of fruit, chocolate, etc. Edwin is the sweetest manager of housekeeping and the rooms were immaculate. He did everything possible to make our stay wonderful. We were actually choked up when we were leaving to go to the airport as we said our good-byes !
