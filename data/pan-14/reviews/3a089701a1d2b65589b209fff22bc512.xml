Can't beat Iberostar when it comes to service and entertainment My wife and I (ages 33 and 35) just returned from our 8 day stay at the Iberostar Dominicana. This is our 5th stay at an Iberostar resort, and from now on we have sworn ourselves to this chain. We have tried the Palladium resorts, Riu chain resorts, and also the Club Med resorts, and nothing can top the Iberostars!Service is OUTSTANDING and the staff is always happy and willing to meet your needs. I was generous in tipping the staff because they went well out of their way to meet the guests' needs like I have never seen before. I was always handed a drink with a smile. They always seemed happy to be there, not miserable like some staff at other hotels have been.Pools were exceptionally clean. Staff raked the beaches every morning for any seaweed that might have washed up. They were always picking cups up around the pool area. The grounds are absolutley pristine and its amazing how meticulously the grounds are cared for. There are always workers outside maintaining the grass, bushes, trees, flowers, etc. There are constantly activities going on if you like to keep busy, but if you'd rather watch or just sit back and relax...then there is always plenty of room to do that too! I promise you won't go wrong in booking this hotel!!!
