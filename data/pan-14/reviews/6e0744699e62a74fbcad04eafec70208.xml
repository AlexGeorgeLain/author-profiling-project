Whatever downsides this hotel may have, it's location is second to none. You really couldn't ask for a better location and their sound proofed windows really do work!I couldn't say i really have any complaints about the hotel as such. As always in Paris the rooms are compact! Though I have stayed in smaller. I am not sure about the extra price we paid to change from a double to a twin room, given the twin was 2 small single beds pushed together anyway - and there wasn't room to separate them even if you wanted to. Otherwise, the hotel was great and not somewhere you didn't want to go back to at night. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it. Though just remember the pictures do make all hotels look better than they are.
