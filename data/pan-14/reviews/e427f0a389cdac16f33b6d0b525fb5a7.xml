They arranged taxis that arrived promptly and with the correct instructions, and provided a free keepsafe for valuables. The hotel was very comfortable and exceedingly clean, and complimentary slippers were provided in the bedroom. A clean Yakata (dressing gown) was provided every day, and a constant supply of hot and cold water and green tea were provided free from a machine on the landing. Toileteries were provided and the toilets in the ensuite bathrooms are western style. There is a fridge and kettle for making a drink, but if you don't want green tea you had better bring your own coffee, milk, etc. There are late-night convenience stores nearby.The excellent restaurant provided Japanese cuisine for dinner and a choice of Japanese or Western breakfast, not included in room price. There was also a good Italian Restaurant one block away.It is easy to reach. We recommend the Keisei Skyliner to Oeno Station from Narita. It is reserved seating only, (ticket desk at Airport Station) so there is no problem with luggage and the journey takes one hour. The slow train runs the same route but takes more than an hour and a half and forget it if you have much luggage. All important signs are in English. There is a taxi rank at Oeno and the fare to the hotel was about 750yen - It is a good idea to have a printout of the hotel name in Japanese to show the driver - they don't all read or understand English. On the way back be sure to ask the taximan for Keisei Oeno station or you will end up in the JR station.
