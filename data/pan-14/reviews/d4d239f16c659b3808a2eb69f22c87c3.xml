Every review I saw was glowing, and I also liked the location. We travel frequently and have stayed in many different hotels, both chain and otherwise. I have to say we were somewhat disappointed. The location is very nice, true. The hotel was nice inside, but we never saw the reason for the glowing reviews. The room was nice but not exceptional. The men who bring in luggage and get you cabs went to great lengths to help us. The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came. Fortunately I always set my cell phone. We came away feeling that while our stay there was fine, we had had similar fine experiences in the chain hotels all over the US. We felt that it wasn't worth the extra money.

We were in no way disappointed. Be warned, it overlooks Conti and Bourbon Streets, and it can be very noisy outside at night. I hear they have inside rooms, but we didn't know that. However, if it's a French Quarter location and a French Quarter type hotel you want, the Prince Conti is superb. We walked everywhere. The Prince Conti is not a chain hotel, so don't expect large impersonal rooms. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the one little problem (broken light switch) was fixed immediately. The real bonus was the staff. Amy at the desk knows EVERYTHING about New Orleans, and she and Peter (also at the desk) set up tours and events for us; they and other hotel employees also made restaurant suggestions which were fantastic. We had a memorable meal every night. When we had a problem with our airport pickup, Amy got right on the phone herself and got someone there for us at once so we didn't miss our flight. I would certainly recommend visiting New orleans (they need the tourism) and staying at this hotel.
