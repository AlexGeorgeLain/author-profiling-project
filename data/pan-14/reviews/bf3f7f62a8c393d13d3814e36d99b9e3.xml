The hotel staff was excellent. They booked our reservations for dinner and also made special arrangements for a private tour of the Garden District with a van operator on the way to the aiport. The weather was lousy and these arrangements were a life saver. The senior rate was $107 plus tax and included a continental breakfast. Fruit offerings could have been better. The king sized bed was comfortable and my room that faced the courtyard was quiet.Clean and ideally located for walking, dining, or gambling. Good ambience as a converted warehouse. The only reason I didn't give an excellent was that the hallways were a little noisy in the early mornings and suite that faced the small street was noisy as the trash trucks drove by early in the morning.
