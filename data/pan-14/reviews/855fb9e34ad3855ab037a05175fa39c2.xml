We were on the first floor next to the canal but the noise was acceptable. We ate in the dining room for breakfast and had catered lunches for our meetings, all of which were good. I liked the location which was certrally located. The internal garden next to and serviced by the bar was epically nice.I thought the staff was uniformaly friendly and attentive.
