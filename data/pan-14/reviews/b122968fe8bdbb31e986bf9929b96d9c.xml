My wife and I were just starting out on our holiday and were spending one night in Venice before embarking on a 15 day cruise around the Mediterranean and then north on the Atlantic to end up in Copenhagen.We were very tired upon arrival (after continuously flying from Vancouver to Calgary to Frankfurt and then on to Venice) and after a slow bus trip from the Venice airport on a hot day it was quite a relief to finally find this very attractive and comfortable little hotel. The reviews that I had read about this place were quite accurate.The Antiche Figure is a real gem and more than I had even expected. The room (311) that we stayed in was very classic with a lovely view out and down the Grand Canal. Everything is easily accessible. The breakfast was perfect! Everything we needed was there and it was super clean and very efficiently attended by a young female server.We know about the importance of packing lightly in Europe (particularly a city like Venice with all its bridges and canals) and pride ourselves on limiting our bags. Even with a pending cruise we were down to 2 bags so you can imagine our concern when only 1 of them accompanied our flight from Frankfurt! Some attention from the front desk to communicate with the airport ensured that our 2nd bag met us in our room onboard the ship the next afternoon! Also, some negotiations with a water taxi (by this same individual) got us a split fare to the cruise terminal with another couple heading that way.All in all, this excellent reception at the Antiche Figure got us off on the right foot to a very successful trip and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
