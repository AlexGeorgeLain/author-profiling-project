The property is very elegant and the room fantastic! I of course raided the minibar and found the bill pretty reasonable considering. Yes the hotel is on top of a railway line as another reviewer mentioned--but we were on the 4th floor and could barely hear it; besides, the line stops running at midnight anyway. Didn't get a chance to try the jacuzzis on the roof but there's an excellent view of the Sagrada Familia from up there. As others have mentioned, it's for breakfast and we skipped that as well, though finding a cafe open on a Sunday morning is a bit tricky! If you walk northeast two blocks to the Rambla de Catalunya (not to be confused with La Rambla which is an awful tourist trap and should be avoided at all costs!), there are several very nice cafes and restaurants. In fact, we found Kess, right near the Passeig de Gracia Metro stop, to be an excellent lunch spot and ate there twice.The hotel itself is a good 10 minute walk from the Metro Diagonal stop, so if you're not up for walking or have loads of luggage, you might have to find a bus route or taxi. We usually travel very light and it wasn't a big deal. The thing I loved the most about the hotel was its location: upscale part of town, away from the obnoxious touristas. Lots of great restaurants around and it's much quieter and safer than the more popular areas southeast.
