Staff very good especially the door staff. We were on the seventeenth floor and the rooms had not been renovated so the bathroom was dated but very clean. No problems with the lifts although they can be a little slow at peak times. But you are on holiday what is the rush! The only problem we had during our stay was the noise from outside. This was because the windows would not close properly and were jammed open leaving a small gap. I always carry earplugs when staying in cities and I slept but it may be a problem if you dont carry them.
