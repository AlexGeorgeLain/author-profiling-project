I had red all the excellent reviews on this hotel and so when I decided to spend five days in Paris I booked at once to College de France. My experience is a bit disappointing: I had a little room to first floor; the window looked at the back side of the Hotel and it was a dirty, sad and disagreable panorama. The staff of the hotel was on average... The better thing is the location of the Hotel, just in the heart of Paris. The price was a very good price (99 euro for a triple room)...but attention: the third bed was not a real bed but a little roll camp-bed! my son of 10 years old could'nt sleep 'cause it was unconfortable and so, I was forced tu put him between me and my wife in our double bed (140 cm. X 3 persons!!!).Anyway: I advise this Hotel if you want to spend a little price and , by the way, if you want to stay in a wonderful location.Next time If I come back to Paris I think I go again to College the france but I'd like a room in an higher floor and with a real bed for the child!!!
