This is defenitly not the Intercontinental but, for the price, its very nice. When we arrived, there was no problem checking in and the staff was very friendly and accomadating, even at 12:30 in the morning. We found our room very clean. Its small, and the bathroom is really tiny, but it works. Its great for just sleeping and taking a quick shower in the morning and heading out. The location is perfect, very close to the beach, about a 1 minute walk to the bus stop (that takes you to Old San Juan), and the restaurant downstairs is also great. Very good Gelato. If you are looking for just somewhere to sleep, this is ideal. Very good for the price. We were expecting the wrose after reading reviews, but were very pleasantly surprised. NO BUGS either ( a huge phobia of mine) A few tips: There is no hair dryer or shampoo or iron in the room, so make sure you bring your own.
