We are at the 30th floor which has a great view of Tokyo especially at night! The location is really great as it is located in the huge shopping mole building close to Ikebukuro station. The 24 hours shop is at the ground floor and in front of this hotel there is a big super market which also open 24hours.There are lots of restaurants in this building, lots of souvenir shops as well. All the staff is very polite and kind and we really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Oh, another important point is that this hotel has a direct shuttle bus from Narita Airport so we didn't suffer from the heavy and big souvenirs as check in to Hotel and the Airport Lounge is door to door. I definitely stay at this hotel for the next visit to Tokyo.
