The hotel was located centrally enough with a short walk to all the major attractions the city has to offer. We stayed for 3 nights from Nov 11th - Nov 14thThe room was well appointed, nice comfy bed, clean and tidy, only one reservation was the extremley small bathroom but it didn't affect me greatly but maybe an issue for some. The wine reception in the evenings is a really nice touch and you are made to feel very welcome. We didnt eat at the hotel but did visit ' Brick ' the bar next door for dinner which was really good and recommended. Like the vast majority of reviews I would highly recommend the hotel for its location, excellent value for money , and very helpful and friendly staff.
