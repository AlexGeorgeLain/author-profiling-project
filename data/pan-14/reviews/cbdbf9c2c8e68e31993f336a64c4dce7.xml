I could live there forever..! I love the bathrooms!! The rooms are big and clean, compared to other hotels in HK that I've stayed in and the staff are really nice and helpful. It helps that the location is great too.. right next to the shopping mall and mong kok, where I can run out in the night to do a little bit more late night shopping. For a good hotel, the price is absolutely reasonable as well. The langham breakfast is scrumptious as well.. If you have the chance, you really should try it!
