I had been to Coconut Grove before-during the day and for dinner, but never stayed overnight. If your are not aware, it can get loud on the weekends...all night long. We had an upgraded king suite in the 17th floor. The view was nice, but we were on the street-side that had traffic and party-goers all night long. Think 17 floors up it would be serene, but it was like we were forced to party along with them. Too bad we had to get up early, and our sleep was required. The A/C unit was like an airplane, but it came in handy to drown out the other noise. In a nutshell, I loved the room service and the staff. The room was great and spotless, but just a VERY loud and uncomfortable location for us. Next time maybe we'll ty another sonesta property in a better location for us.
