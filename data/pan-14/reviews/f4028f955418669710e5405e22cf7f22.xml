The first thing is that dogs are allowed in this hotel which would be fine if they were only allowed in certain rooms. When I arrived my room had dog hair on the floor and a dog barking in the next room. I complained 2 times to the staff and they kept telling me that they would contact the dogs owners. The dog continued barking all night till the owners returned home. THe barking stated again at 7 am. We were not offered a different room.The room was ok - not horrible, not great. The location is good for all theatres. The restuarant next door (District) was pricey and not at all worth it.. Plenty of local restuarants have pre-theatre price fix dinners that are alot better and cheaper. There are better hotels in the area for the same price.
