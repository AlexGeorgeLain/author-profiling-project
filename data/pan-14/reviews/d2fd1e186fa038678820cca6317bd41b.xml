We had a suite for our family of 4 , with 2 teenage daughters- plenty of room , nicely furnished, quiet , 2 tvs so no arguments, nice bathroom. The only difficulty was that the sofabeds are not very comfortable , so our girls felt they had to put up with this all week. We requested another matress to put on top but this did not arrive. Apart from that, we all loved this hotel - very relaxed, the buffet breakfast was just right for our needs , enough variety and very flexible, with eggs, cereals , lovely breads etc. Tea and coffee, biscuits and wine/cheese in the evening available free, made for a casual welcoming atmosphere, with no sense that 'it cost money to breathe' as you get in many large formal hotels. The computer in the lobby is very useful. This hotel was not cheap but is good value, especially considering breakfast is included. The staff were friendly and helpful. There are many good restaurants nearby and from this location it is easy to get anywhere in Manhatten. I would recommend the mexican restaurant next door - the margueritasare very good.
