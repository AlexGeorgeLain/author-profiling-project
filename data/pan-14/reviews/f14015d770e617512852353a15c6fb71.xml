Much like UK Travelodges the hotels was no frills but clean and tidy with a good size room and bathroom. There was also a microwave, good size fridge and dishes that allowed for basic catering. Also there was a iron and ironing board, as well as all other comforts that you'd expect in a hotel room.The hotel was a 10 minute walk from Central station and a 25 minute walk to Circular Quay. All the main attractions were in easy walking distance. We would definately stay here again.
