Comfortable beds with four choices of pillow, large bathroom. Staff were very polite and helpful. Would have scored excellent had it not been for the noise. Something I was aware of because of the proximity of nightclubs in Rembrant Square. Great location though in the heart of Amsterdam, within 10-20 minutes walking distance of virtually all attractions. So if you are a heavy sleeper or just out partying all night then this is the perfect place for you.
