The only space available was one of the apts. which we were told was nice by the staff. Wrong, it was terrible. No telephone, no contact with hotel staff, totally cut off from hotel. Accomodations were a bed and chair with drape thrown over it. We said we can't stay in the room, desk said okay, no charge, then called owner who said we would be charged full rate! Nightmare!
