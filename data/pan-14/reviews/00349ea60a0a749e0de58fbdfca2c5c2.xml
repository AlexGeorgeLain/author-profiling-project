The grounds were well cared for and the lobby gorgeous. My travel agent booked through Apple and there was an Apple rep in the larger lobby area. This was both convient and comforting. The beach was the most beautiful I've seen. Plenty of room and seats to sunbathe. Our room was spacious and clean. A wet bar in the room was just right for evening cocktails on the porch of our room. The staff were friendly and courteous. We did, however, have problems with water pressure in our room. Though the food selection had a wide variety, it was only fair tasting and left us with minor stomache trouble. The entertainment had an impressively wide range, but could be amateurish at times. All tried hard though wich made it, for the most part, fun. The beach and pool area had a burger and hot dog stand. It was so bad it had an almost comic value! AVOID! While we were there, a fire burnt down a large building! near the pool and beach closing at least 3 restaurants. Even so, there were still plenty of places to eat and drink and the staff worked very hard to clean up and make up for the loss. The grounds are HUGE and though they have regular shuttle service to and from the rooms and lobby, be ready for long walks. Not the fanciest place in the world but was appropiately priced and I had a great time.
