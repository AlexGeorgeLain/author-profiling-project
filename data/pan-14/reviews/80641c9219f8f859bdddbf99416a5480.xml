In the last two years, we, our brother, and our daughter made separate trips. All had problems: no hot water, no water, backed up toilets, unusable room. All these things happen. THe real problem is the staff is unhelpful, if not rude. The resort otherwise OK and the beach is beautiful. But until they can offer decent facilities and a helpful staff, we can't recommend this resort.
