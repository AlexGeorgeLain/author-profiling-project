Hotel facilities are very good, lovely rooms, good breakfast, staff were very pleasant and helpful to us.I can certainly recommend this hotel. Go to 'El Glop' in for a lovely meal.

Can't agree with reviews about good service - once booked in I felt we were forgotten. Maybe Spanish 5 star but this hotel is probably 3 star plus for us Brits. E-mailed hotel twice before I arrived explaining we were celebrating our silver anniversary was surprising my wife with choice of hotel to help arrange restaurant bookings upgrade rooms - both e-mails were ignored. Towels bath-robes hard not fluffy like they should be. No tea/coffee making facilities disappointing. Our first visit to Barcelona was still fantastic - will return but not to the Majestic.

Only complaint was my bill - overcharged by $800 for a 5 night stay, but this was rectified very promptly. Rooms are lovely but not tea/coffee making facilities in rooms facing ground zero.
