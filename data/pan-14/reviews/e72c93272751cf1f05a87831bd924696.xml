The breakfast is very good with very efficient and professional service.The hotel is modern, good elevators, nice restaurants (a bit expensive for diner). The spa and fitness area is not large but enough. It's very well mantained,clean, very good service, sauna, steam room and the swimming pool has A GREAT and amazing VIEW over the city !!!The hotel is located 10 minutes by tram from the main central station of Frankfurt. The hotel also has several taxis in front of the hotel. Internet gratis, tea facilities in the room, heated floor in the bathroom. The only min. point is a window between the bedroom and the bathroom, totally unnecessary (I would never stay with my funny friends in the same bedroom because of this window that has curtine that can be opened from the bedroom side...We loved this hotel and will definetly come back.The reception is very friendly, professional and we had a great welcome upon arriving.
