We had such a fantastic 3 nights in the Agora Saint germain.Being only a 2 minute walk from Notre Dame, the location was fantastic. There was a lovely cafe around the corner that did breakfast for a reasonable price, around 15 euros for 4 croissants and 2 Orange Juices.The hotel was clean, with friendly staff working at the reception.I must admit, we laughed when we saw the lift, it is quite small.The rooms looked as if they had been recently renovated with a very 'funky' 21st century style bathroom.If we went back to Paris, I would definately book to stay here again! Dont hesitate to contact me if you want any further information!
