I booked the Mediteraranean Inn hoping for a clean, safe and friendly place to stay, which is exactly what I got. The rooms are large and well-equipped, even having microwaves and fridges, which is always useful. The free internet in the lobby was fab, as was the on-site Starbucks.As for location, as a young female travelling alone I felt very safe going out at night, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. It's about a 20-minute walk into downtown Seattle but only 5-minutes from the Seattle Centre and Space Needle where there's a metro located for anyone not fancying the stroll.My only real complaint with the hotel was their refusal to accept my Maestro debit card - i didn't realise that in the US debit cards are accepted in very few places, and that a maestro card is virtually unheard of. Just in-case anyone out there is as oblivious as me...take a credit card or at the very least a visa debit with you before setting foot in the US!!
