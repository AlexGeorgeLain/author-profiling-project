We booked this reservation back in the early spring while planning a trip to see the ball game. The price was $189.00/night which inluded one round of golf. Since green fees are $145.00, it was a bargain. When we arrived we learned the pool was closed for resurfacing which was a bummer for my wife who was not going to the game on Sunday with us guys. She was allowed to use the pool across the street at the hotel at the golf club. There was a free shuttle or she could was the 100 yards.We actually got two free golf passes at check in which saved us another $145.00 and we got $10 off the quoted rate ($179.00). So we made out real well on the weekend as far as the cost of the room.The villa was very large, clean, and had a well equipped kitchen. The master bath had a large shower and a huge tub. The water was plentiful and hot and the a/c worked great.The staff was curtious and helpful. There was no attempt to sell us a timer share. They printed our return boarding passes and arranged for a shuttle for my wife to take to the airport on Sunday. They extended her checkout time to 2pm. which was very helpful.The only negative for the weekend was that we went to the resort across the street for breakfast on saturday and had them valet park our car for 45 minutes. They charged us $11.00 to valet the car which we wouldn't have done had we known the cost. We didn't complain in light of the free round of golf we got.The golf was great and the game even better.
