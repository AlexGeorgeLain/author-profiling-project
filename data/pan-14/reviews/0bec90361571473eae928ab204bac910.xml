A bit on the expensive side, but it was generally modern, elegant, attractive and funky. Free fully functioning in room WIFI included. First I was put in a very small room with no windows, I did not like that! It was changed next day no problem. Lively streets, but excellent glazing keeps it quiet inside if you prefer. Breakfast is good but expensive (they almost seemed to panic when they discovered I was having breakfast one morning, not included in my deal, but relaxed when I flashed my key and credit card). Starbucks is right next door, not too cheap either, but nice outside seating. The location of the hotel is very good near Metro, sightseeing bus start, shopping, and head of las Ramblas. I would gladly stay here again for business or pleasure, but be more alert about getting a good room from the start.
