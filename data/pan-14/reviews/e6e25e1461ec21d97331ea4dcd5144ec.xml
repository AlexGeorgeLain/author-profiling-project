Upon arrival the reception staff were polite, welcoming and friendly, and the process of checking in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 2nd floor, at the back of the hotel. Whilst the room was smaller then we expected, it was clean and had everything we needed. The bathroom looked recently renovated, with a wet room style shower. Towels were changed every day, and the room cleaned. We didnt have any problem with noise, being at the back of the hotel it was away from the main street and therefore quiter. Breakfast was delivered to the room every morning, a time having being arranged the previous day, and consisted of a fresh warm bread roll, cheese, jam, butter, a strawberryorange smoothie, tea or coffee and an After Eight chocolate! Everything was fresh and individually packed. We stayed 5 days and all of the reception staff and cleaning staff we came across during our stay were helpful and friendly at all times. We would certainly stay at this hotel again.
