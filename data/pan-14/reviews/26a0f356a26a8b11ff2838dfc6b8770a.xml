Our bathroom had only a shower, which was fine with us. The WC itself is in the same space but the door can close it leaving the sink and shower free for others to use. Really sophisticated. The room was small-medium in size. What I did not like at all is the there is no wardrobe, only a few open shelves. A desk with no drawer, and only 1 chair. Another chair would be great although the room is small. Staff - young and nice, but when the hotel was full they did not cope so well. We had a problem and it was not dwelt properly. Breakfast - a small buffet with rolls, jams, cereals, salami and cheese and some other items. The same everyday. Thgey did not replentish items fast enough, and many times items were missing for over 20 minutes. Location is very good, with good transport right out of the door, some restaurants and a nice cafe next door. It is suitable for a short stay 1-2 nights, for longer stay it is not that comfortable. Room too small and no where to put your staff.
