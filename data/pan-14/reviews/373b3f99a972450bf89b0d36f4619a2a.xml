The hotel is generally OK but getting shabby - good for an extended stay as there is a kitchenette, basic but functional and clean. Some of the staff are a bit surly (as in customers are a nuisance). The hotel book in the room said that calls to 1-800 and 1-888 numbers are free for the first 20 minutes. On checking out I saw that every call I made was billed at $ 2.66 (even for two minutes) - when I queried it they showed me a bit of paper that said $ 1.50 for the first twenty minutes which did not match the charges built into their computer system. (By the way WiFi is charged at $10 per day while many other hotels provide it free - in any case the signal was not strong enough in the higher floors).Because of the discrepancies the reception called the duty manager who did not explain or apologize and in the end after making me wait re funded me the calls. I reported this to the HQ of Affinia who did not bother to acknowledge or reply. Suggest you check your bill for unexpected charges before you leave.
