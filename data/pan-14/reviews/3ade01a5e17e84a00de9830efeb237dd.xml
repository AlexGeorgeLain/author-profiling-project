A five minute walk from Central Station and right on the tram line to the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum. And a ten minute walk from the Anne Frank house. The staff were very helpful and friendly, the hotel itself was ver nice. Definitely four star, also a decent size room for Europe. We got a Sunday night on Priceline for $100.
