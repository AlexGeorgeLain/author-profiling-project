I found it to be an excellent hotel with good service throughout. I had the Crown Club update which gives free breakfast in your room, free use of the pool/gym/sauna as well as free drinks and nibbles in the crown club between 5.30 and 8.30.I had a room on the 16th floor with a decent view of the harbour.Watch out for the prices in the Martini bar, but room service is decent value. All in all a confortable and clean hotel in a good location. I'd be happy to stay there again.
