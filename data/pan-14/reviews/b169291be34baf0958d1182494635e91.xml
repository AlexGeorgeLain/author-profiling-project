Located exactly on the former East/West border it is in a good location for seeing the city of Berlin. Just 5 minutes to the underground train, 20 minutes walk to the Museum island. There is a very reasonable Italian restaurant across the road.On Leipziger Strs nearby there is a supermarket, and Turkish donerkebab stands. The hotel was clean, comfortable, quiet, well-run, with a very good breakfast. I would recommend it.From: An Israeli visitor to Berlin.
