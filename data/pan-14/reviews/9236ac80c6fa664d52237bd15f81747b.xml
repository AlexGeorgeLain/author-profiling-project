The staff made us very welcome provided us with a city map details on how to keep ourselves our personal belongings safe. Our hotel bedroom bathroom were spotlessly clean, and we found several very useful accessories had been left for us, e.g. travel toothpaste brush, shower cap, soap, shower gel. comb, shoe clean kit etc. There was no outlook from the window, but this was not a problem. Stepping out into the street we found several bars restaurants enjoyed a nice evening with very little interference from street sellers. We enjoyed a very good hotel buffet breakfast which was priced at 15euros each, plenty of choice served in an immaculate dining room.The hotel is situated within a short distance of La Ramblas we walked there the next morning. (Would not recommend walking through the back streets at night). We were able to leave our luggage in our room until midday so we found this very convenient.Having read poor reviews for this hotel we were delighted to stay in such a comfortable and well run establishment can certainly recommend it. We will be happy to stay here again when next in Barcelona.
