Great.1 week Travelodge Wyngard Sydney, very good for location,Rooms better than I expected,ask for the back as quieter..Very busy place with tours coming and going. Breakfast buffet very good but expensive 20au$ pp. Plenty of other places nearby.Much to do and see in Sydney.The Sydney Explorer Bus to Watsons Bay/Gap Great views,( the famous Fish and Chips!, Rubbish) then to Bondi.Very disappointed,but the walk around the headland toTamarama and Bronte Beach was the Highlight.Good day out.3rd week to Port Douglas, Bueatiful. Clean, Green,open spaces,only 3 storey buildingsMax. The trip to the Barrier Reef great.We went on the Poseidon boat,wow what service,good food and really looked after.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.Stayed at the Macossan House.just back of the main street.Very good clean apartment.highly recommended.
