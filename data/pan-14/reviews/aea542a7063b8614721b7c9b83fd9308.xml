Didn't know much about the hotel but it looked good and had a good price.I ended up staying here for 8 nights.6 with my g/f. 2 with a friend.Both rooms were on the Executive floor.From the very start service was outstanding. So so friendly. At check-in there was a problem with my room, due to me wanting a King bed and them booking a twin. Problem was rectified after they personally showed me some rooms to make sure I was happy with them. Made check-in a little bit longer but they were very helpful and it was kinda fun.Rooms are nice. Nothing ultra modern, nothing dated. Nice and comfortable. The great thing about this hotel is that you get a PC with free internet! In our room we had a tv facing the bed and a PC on a separate desk.Breakfast was great, we were in a smaller area due to being on the executive level - no queues for the omelette guy which was great!The only other restaurant at the hotel we tried was the sushi bar - it was average.There is a train station directly underneath the hotel and another one 5 minutes walk away.The area the hotel is in is a bit further from the 'action' of Tokyo. However, it has great restaurants and feels a lot more relaxed and homely. You get the feeling you could be staying at a apartment because its not all glitzy and touristy.The nighttime cabs back from Shibuya will hurt your wallet though!Overall - Perfect comfortable stay. Nothing bad. Great service, always smiling, always willing to help and genuinely friendly.
