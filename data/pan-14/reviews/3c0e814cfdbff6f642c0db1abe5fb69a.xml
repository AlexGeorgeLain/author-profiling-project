The best thing about this hotel is the location, a short walk to Vondelpark (great little cafe called 'Small Talk' just around the corner from Van Gogh museum) Leidseplein, in a safe area and close to the trams. Contrary to previous reviews we found the staff quite helpful (on arrival our bags were carried up the steep stairs!). I can't recommend the hotel for the following reasons... the first room we stayed in was not clean, walls need to be painted (also true of second room we stayed in), the shower did not work properly, no hand towels during the entire stay, bed linen was clean but old and worn, no lift, breakfast very poor standard and overcrowded seating arrangements, overpriced and not good value for money. Despite best efforts of the hardworking staff I don't believe this hotel deserves 3 star status. We have stayed in many 3 star hotels and guesthouses throughout Europe (including Amsterdam) that are of a much higher standard than this.
