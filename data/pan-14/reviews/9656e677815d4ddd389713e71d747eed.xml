Short walk to the Red Light District and the main town center, but on a quiet and upscale street. The only criticism that I have is that they allow smoking in the lobby is no way for a non-smoker to by pass the smoke in order to get to your room! They will hold your bags after you check out for free which is a nice service.

Loved the hotel, great stay- great location near the subway station and near the main shopping area. Walking distance to the city center. There is no wireless internet in the room, but they do provide FREE wired LAN service. Bring your LAN cable for your laptop! The only criticism that I have is the prices. I purposely booked my room on the internet with no breakfast as breakfast is 22 Euros per person per day! Yikes! And they charged me for breakfast (I even enter the restaurant) anyway. The front desk person when I checked out was nice enough to ask and take it off for me. Beware of EXTRA charges on your bill. I was charged 20 Euros for calls I make!.
