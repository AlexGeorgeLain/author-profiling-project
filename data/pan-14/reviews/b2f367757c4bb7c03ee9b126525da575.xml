Obviosly the hotel is still the same , the bay view room is a beatiful room with a fantastic view and a good size. However I did find some small problems compared with the past stay of August 2005:1) In an hotel like the FS you're expecting the best and the tv system of the FS Miami is not up to the best standard now available. I was expecting a change to a Flat screen tv..2) The hotel staff has changed and some of them ( especially at the reception ) are not very polite. I found a much more warm welcome the past time3) The Aqua restaurant has changed menu and type of cuisine , not more Italian but much more american. The chief is new and he's from Thailand.. For me an horrible change , the Italian menu was much much better.. And the service is very slow, the same for breakfast , lunch or dinner..3) The pool area is fantastic but the service is not of the same level.Valet parking is good but I'd like better the valet at the RC.. Second stay and probably the last one.. Next time I will try a different hotel in Miami , probably the Mandarin Oriental.

Just back from a four days stay at the Peninsula Hotel in Tokyo and I have mixed feelings about my local stay. Check in was quick but my deluxe room was not ready and this was not so good after a very long trip from Europe. After an 30 minutes wait it was finally ready... I was at the 9th floor despite I was asking for an high floor room. The room is really nice and in my opinion compared with the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills and New York is by far better. A lot of details have been created to garantee an high level of satisfaction and pleasure. So the room, the living area , the bathroom are really great except of the view , really no special.. Did try several times the restaurant at the hotel entrance and I still do not understand the decision of the Peninsula people do not create a different place for breakfast as well lunch or dinner.. So in my opinion a very negative choice. The breakfast menu was nothing special and if you compare it with the the breakfast in New Tork it seems to stay in two different world. The continental breakfast is made with one croissant , one pc of bread and one muffin, plus coffe and juice. Of course they are pleased to bring you some more bread or croissant but the first feeling for a basket almost empty is horrible. I had a very nice experience at Spa , one the best recently ; a very nice pool area as well a fantastic massage and very professional people.. The location of the hotel is simply great and the area is full of fantastic shops , restaurant and very nice to simply walking the street from the back entrance of the hotel.As a great fans of the Peninsula chain I have been not completely satisfied with my last stay.. The service is great , full of people smiling but they night before of my departure no sign of any turndown service in my room .. so another mistake.Tokyo is full of great hotels and I'm not sure If i will select again Peninsula for my next stay..

Booked a typical FS Deluxe Room with a nice wiew. Small TV with no Plasma , no w-lan service in the rooms , bathroom nice but not more than this... Had several problems with the Management , very noisy room , service not similar to other FS hotels. So sorry to say but the RItz Carlton in San Francisco is a better hotel and next time I will stay at the Ritz..

Have been there for a couple of nights at the end of July 2008. Booked a simply superior room with a main Hudson view. The room was not huge but very nice with a lot of useful tech advantages and features. The bed was very comfortable despite of some really soft pillows. Bathroom perfect in size and very nice. Service absolutely fantastic, very nice view also if it not was not a Central Park room view. Enjoy a wonderful breakast ( also if is the service it was a little bit too slow ) at the Asiate Resturant. Unfortunately did not use the Spa or other services. So , one if the not the best hotel in New York right now , also if it was expensive. I really like new and High Tech hotel and this Mandarin it was in my opinion a true perfect layout . Additional to this , check in and check out were perfect and very quick , as well room service . Bravo Mandarin !
