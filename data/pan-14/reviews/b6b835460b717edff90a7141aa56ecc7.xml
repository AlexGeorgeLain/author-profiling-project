Bathroom was clean and modern with good shower.Only downside was that there are no safe facilities in the room but there is a safe facility (at extra charge) from the reception. Rooms were quite small with very limited space around the beds (meaning my mate who was in the bed nearest the window cracked his shin on my bed every time he walked past!)All in all an excellent hotel if you are looking for somewhere on a budget and only really want a bed and a secure room. I do not reccomend this hotel to anyone with mobility difficulties as the breakfast room is down some typically amsterdam style steep twisting stairs with no lift. Lift access to all other floors is available.
