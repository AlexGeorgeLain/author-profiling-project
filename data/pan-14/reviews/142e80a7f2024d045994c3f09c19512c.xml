I booked hotel Itaca through h10.es website, room prices on double for single use were 67 euros for two nights and 83 e for last night including breakfast buffee. What get is five star service for price of three or four. Free Cava for welcoming and on breakfast though other guests were quite passive having a free drink. There is a large supermercado around the corner where you can get drinks, crisps etc. cheaply so you have to pay high minibar prices. Room was small but comfortable. Bathroom was equipped with toiletries and many towels. No bathrobe though.Breakfast buffee was standard, greasy scrambled eggs and bacon to satisfy british customers. Coffee pot was served to table but coffee was only warm not hot.Location of hotel Itaca is very good. Avinguada de Roma is busy street but noise so much issue. It is couple of hundred meters to Barcelo Sants train station and to metro.It took about 30 minutes to walk to the Catalonia plaza. Taxi costs from 6 to 9 euros.
