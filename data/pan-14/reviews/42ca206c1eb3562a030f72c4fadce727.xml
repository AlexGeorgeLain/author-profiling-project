I chose this hotel after reading previous reviews and also because it had a great deal on room prices.still not sure what to expect as all views subjective. however it is in a great position for sightseeing,the single room was fine altho a little dark and would probably be noisy in summer with the shutters open.a very good breakfast and pleasant friendly staff.one word of warning -most rooms are up stairs at various levels-altho there is a lift from street level to reception.would certainly stay here again.

		<document id="23d81798ee004069f556ee7a0bcd0b87" url=""><![CDATA[good experience Have just returned from my third trip to Florence, staying this time at the Carolus Hotel.A very comfortable stay, room was nicely decorated with a decent size bathroom with a proper shower cubicle ( no paddling on wet floors !) All very up to date.Only let down was the breakfast room which cannot cope if hotel is fully booked.There are not enough tables or waiting staff-only two waiters and tables remained uncleared and you had to look for a waiter. However the hotel is very conveniently situated with local buses nearby if you need them.I was on the top (3rd) floor at the front and there is some street noise despite double glazing and shutters. The traffic dies off after 11pm so a good nights sleep is possible and there are some very pleasant views. The staff were very helpful and other than the breakfast problems I had a great stay and would return there if I can get a booking.Seems to be a very popular hotel.
