It is just a few yards up a side street from the bustling square but our room, which overlooked the courtyard, was very quiet. There was some music from the courtyard on two nights but this stopped promptly before midnight. We didn't hear any city noise at all.The room was well equipped and well designed and the bathroom was spacious. The staff were very helpful indeed and the breakfast was excellent. I would recommend this hotel highly; even though we are older travellers, we were able to walk comfortably to many of the places we wanted to visit and felt very safe going out to dinner late and returning even later!!We really enjoyed our four day visit and would consider returning to Barcelona and to this hotel.
