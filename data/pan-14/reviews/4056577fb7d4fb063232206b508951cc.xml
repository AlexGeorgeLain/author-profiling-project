We stayed here for two nights in late August and loved everything about it. First, the location was great. It was within walking distance of both the waterfront and Pike Place Market, and we could easily take the monorail to the Space Needle. (There are hills in Seattle, so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking, you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi.) Both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated, and the staff was very helpful. Being on Pioneer Square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink and/or something to eat. Of course, we didn't walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there, but that's just common sense. We were never bothered by anyone, and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city. If you're worried about street noise, call the hotel directly and ask for an interior room. We had an interior king and it was very quiet. We plan to return to Seattle, and when we do, we'll stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel again.
