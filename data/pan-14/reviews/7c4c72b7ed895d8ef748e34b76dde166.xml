However, it did not feel like a Westin - from the rude front desk staff to the lack of helpful doormen, the service at this Westin was really lacking and not up to par with other Westins - I suspect this is one of those licensed properties and not under the direct control of Starwood. This is reflected in the standards of service which were low. The room was ok - i was on a high floor as a Starwood Platinum. LCD TV in the room, nice bed, and individual coffee maker was nice. Bathroom was small, and wireless internet was always weak signal the entire time, and it kept disconnecting. When you pay $14 or so, you expect that the signal is strong and that it doesnt keep dropping you. I had to ask for the toiletries to be replaced since the maid didnt replenish shampoo or shower gel. Room service menu is limited and expensive - plenty of nearby restaurants thankfully. Location of the hotel is great as long as you dont expect the staff to go out of its way to help you. Have already changed my future reservations for San Francisco to stay elsewhere.

From the moment the uniformed agent met me outside customs and whisked me away to the hotel in a large, new Black Mercedes sedan to check in to the remainder of my stay, it was perfect in every way. Even though checking in at 3am (delayed flights due to weather in China), the hotel staff was ready for me. The room was a harbor view room complete with binoculars to look across the harbor from Central. Hermes toiletries abound. The bath area was incredible, complete with soaking tub and a FULL range of toiletries for all needs (nails, teeth, shaving and much more). Beds were very comfortable. VERY ample supply of free bottled water. State of the art flat screen TVs. Very large in room safe. Terry cloth and silk roabs as choice. Slippers that actually fit large feet like mine. The health club on the 24th floor was amazing too. Very large. Nice facilities overall. Breakfast was included in my rate at their buffet on the mezzanine level was first rate. Car service back to the airport was also flawless, except for a small wait for my pick up due to heavy traffic near the hotel. Once at the airport, a uniformed valet took me all through the process right up to security. Very nice. I cant wait to go back!

I love this hotel and will keep coming back. It's hip, modern, fashionable and VERY well located - cant have a better location in Florence than perched right above the Ponte Vecchio over the Arno river! The rooms are white and soft... very clean modern furnishings, baths/showers and beds. Hotel staff at the front desk is VERY helpful and willing to find solutions to your needs. They even do small favors such as have a pair of pants hemmed for me at the last minute by the hotel staff. They made excellent recommendations for non-touristy restaurants nearby as well, and they arranged for a private car and driver to take us to the nearby outlets. Thsi hotel has a warm, friendly and inviting atmosphere. The staff is very welcoming and you feel like a gest in someon's home in many ways. It was not terribly crowded during the Christmas holiday week so it was a nice break from the crowds seen there in the summer. One thing to note - they close their incredible rooftop terrace during the cold months which is a shame - nothing a few outdoor heaters couldnt solve so you can appreciate the incredible view! The wi-fi internet connection was also included in the room. We did not have breakfast in our rate and did not eat in the restaurant on this recent trip, but they do have a nice place to eat inside the hotel. They also have a small gym with modern equipment right on property and a sauna for hotel guests. Overall, a GREAT experience. Will be back for sure!

They have combined about 25 historic old buildings together to form a sprawling hotel with courtyards and gardens at the center. I am a Starwood Platinum member and checked in assuming I would be given my upgrade to the best available room (this wording according to policies by Starwood). I had reserved a Deluxe room. They said they were upgrading me to an Executive Room because of my status. The room didnt appear to be any different than the room i had booked. Because these are old historic buildings, they are typically small rooms. I understand that, but when Starwood says you will be upgraded to the best available room and the hotel is not full, and it has junior suites available that are much bigger, and you have been given a small interior room with no real view, you begin to wonder. I stayed one night because I was jet lagged. But i called the duty manager the next night and asked for a larger room. At first he fed me some story about small rooms. I insisted and was about to call Starwood in the US (that usually works, by the way) and he said he would give me the junior suite. The manager acted like he was doing me a favor. But the back of my platinum card actually spells out the policies. They tried to just give me an upgrade to the next class of room, not the best class. BEWARE - if you are entitled to it and you dont make progress with the local manager, call Starwood Preferred Guest in the US. Other things to note: PROS: 2 free stroopfwaffles each day; GREAT BEDS! (some of the most comfortable i have slept in); good assortment of toiletries; plenty of electrical outlets (pet peeve when they dont have enough); helpful concierge; fashionable and good restaurant; GREAT location for walking to everything; BEAUTIFUL views on that canal, said to be one of the best in the city.CONS (in addition to feedback shown above): expensive wi-fi service (19 euros for 24 hours); mold/mildew in the shower areas (in both rooms i saw); repeated requests for extra towels went ignored; not very helpful valet.Other things to know: the large revolving front door is locked after midnight at some point - you need to press the green lighted button on the bellstand which then rings the night manager inside to let you in; the cafe off the main lobby is expensive for coffee - plenty of local nice places on the 9 Streets which are literally on the next block down; concierge desk has plenty of umbrellas at their desk if you need to borrow one; lighting inside the rooms seemed a bit sparse if you like it bright; you cannot put anything in most of the room refrigerators because they are the automated mini bars where if you take anythign out it bills you -- the junior suite had a small regular refrigerator though; they have plenty of papers to choose from; some bathrooms seemed to have heated marble floors - nice on a cold morning.
