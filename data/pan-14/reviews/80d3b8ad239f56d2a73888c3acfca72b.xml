We enjoyed the breakfasts, a good variety of fresh food, and no queues for the dining room in October!The Internet access was a bonus, and the lift good for going back to our room after long days of sight-seeing. We can also recommend the excellent bus service, and the charming young lady in the Tourist Office by Santa Maria Novellawho advised us about the Tickets.We would certainly stay at Hotel Globus again, and have no hesitation in adding our recommendation to the many others on this website.
