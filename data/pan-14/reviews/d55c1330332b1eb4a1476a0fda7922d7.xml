The staff all spoke excellent English and they were very helpful and efficient in dealing with all our requests. The position of the hotel is excellent on a quiet street off Kurfurstendamn yet within a few minutes walk of the Zoo and of Wittenbergplatz. There are plenty of clothes and shoe stores here and also many restaurants. The U-Bahn is easily accessible although at present there is a lot of disruption on the line into the Mitte area. All three of the rooms we had in the hotel were very plain in but had every thing we needed and in addition two had small balconies over the courtyard which always pleases me. Bathrooms were fine with excellent power showers the curtains were inclined to block the water outlets. The beds were a little on the firm side for my taste but were clean as was the rest of the hotel.However the best point about the hotel (other than the staff) was the really excellent breakfast. This was extensive, with bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs available in addition to a large variety of cereals, fresh fruit and dried fruit. Also there was a large selection of rolls, toast and smoked and cold meats and cheese including smoked salmon. This is normally, I believe, about 13 Euros each but we got it as a bed and breakfast deal - an excellent bargain.If we visit Berlin again we will certainly use this hotel and recomend it to our friends.
