Since the package price was pretty cheap, I estimate that the motel cost less than $50.00 per night. The motel and grounds are in need of renovation, but our room was quite clean. We liked the large shower and didn't miss a tub. The staff swept the parking lot and the walkways daily. We found the staff pleasant and helpful. Some of the motel has two stories, we were in a section that had one story. It was very convenient to park our rental car right outside our window. The location was a real bonus - easy access to route 280 and 101. We spent two days visiting the city (@ 20 minutes away) and three other days exploring the coast and hill towns. The airport noise and traffic did not bother us as others have mentioned. This was an inexpensive, decent place to sleep after a long day of sightseeing, nothing more.
