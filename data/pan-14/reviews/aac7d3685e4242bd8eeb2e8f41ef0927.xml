The doorman is a little scuffy. we were impressed with the public areas.we checked in and found the room nice no but no view whatsoever...we waited and hour and a half for our bags and we were very upset as I needed them. While we waited we discovered the light was falling off the wall and the music speaker was malfuntioning...they did not have an iron in the room and the one they had was in use...unexcusable for this expense!! They did fix all the problems promptly and I feel that the problems at this hotel are the managements fault.. there is no pool or hot tub either....as others have said all inquires seemed to be an annoyance for them. service is indeed spotty..the food was just OK not really up to Westin standards...the ritz is across the street ...the Westin needs to take an interest in upgradeing this hotel
