We were a little concerned about the construction. There was not much noise when we were in the hotel, even when we had the windows opened.The room was large and lovely. Very clean. We especially liked the bathroom, with a large marble tub. The bed was very comfortable and plenty of pillows, which is sometimes a problem for those needing more than one. Breakfast was nice with a good variety of cold and hot foods. The staff was professional and friendly. We were only at this hotel for two nights, but we enjoyed our experience. Would stay again, especially if we were traveling by train again.

The staff speaks English very well, but indulged my desire to improve my Italian. Our room was comfortable with a view of the Grand Canal. Opening the windows at night provided a great breeze. We enjoyed having wine and coffee at the tables outside the hotel after a day of taking in the sights of Venice.We found the location of the hotel to be great for taking a water taxis. It is across from the train station and all water taxis make the station a stop. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Especially liked being able to get a cup of coffee to take to our room before going down to eat.The Hotel Antiche Figure was the first stop on our trip to Italy and no other hotel matched their service.
