Two out of three people in my party got extremely sick and had to take antibiotics and stay in bed. The doctor for the resort said that hundreds of guests at this resort have become sick recently. I am not sure what the cause is. If it is a bug, then it is not the fault of the resort. However, on one occasion, I saw a hotel restaurant employee go to the bathroom and not wash her hands. Also, the hotel re-heats food that is not eaten and serves it again for the next several days. In particular, the fish restaurant serves old food.Apart from the illness problem, the food at this resort is the worst I or anyone in my party has ever had at an all-inclusive resort. While you can certainly find something to eat, most of the food is over-cooked and bland - basically glorified cafeteria fare.The grounds, beach and rooms are all lovely. There is construction, but it is not noisy or bothersome. The staff are all very nice and helpful.
