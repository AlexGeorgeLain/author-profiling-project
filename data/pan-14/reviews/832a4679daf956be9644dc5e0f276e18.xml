We upgraded and had a superior room and that made all the difference. It was large and quite comfortable, and very imaginatively furnished. The staff is multi-lingual and very friendly. It is well located in the heart of the commercial and tourist district and one can take the inexpensive bus that runs from the airport and walk about a block and a half to the hotel. We never ate in the hotel so we cannot say anything about the food. They have a solarium on the 6th floor which is lovely in good weather. In light of the cost of hotels in Europe and the strength of the Euro against the dollar, this hotel struck us a reasonably good value, especially since it would be hard to find a better location.
