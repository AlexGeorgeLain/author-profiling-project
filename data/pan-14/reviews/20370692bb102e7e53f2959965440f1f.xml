Very smooth check in with pleasant staff and a great buffet breakfast. The rooms are great. Large enough for two adults and two teens. Shower a little counter intuitive for Europeans but hardly a big issue.Location as has been pointed out is superb with short walks to Boylston and Newbury St shopping. Easy stroll to Boston Common and if you want even through to Cambridgeshire Mall and Fanueil Hall. Subway is close if you prefer although stations being rebuilt this year and public AC not very effective/non existent. Would like to return. Costs very very reasonable for centre of a US city and much better than anything in NYC.

		<document id="c357f77c1bc8e25fb6ae2b3d91bd7566" url=""><![CDATA[Best Airport hotel in bad circumstances Reason for Stay: As ever most visitors stay here because they are defaulting from flying out of Frankfurt. This should not be the case as it is in fact a very nice hotel and therefopre unlike 99% of all other airport hotels in the UK, Europe or US.Rooms: These are very modern and Germanically clean. The attention to design detail is pleasing. The staff are very welcoming and particularly as must get a lot of very tired and irritable customers. I think they should be congratulated. Cable TV is very wide and a good range of sports and news is standard I guess with all Sheraton.I found it expensive at 360 Euro for bed and breakfast and one in roommeal but then again in this circumstance it was an oasis in an otherwise tedious trip.
