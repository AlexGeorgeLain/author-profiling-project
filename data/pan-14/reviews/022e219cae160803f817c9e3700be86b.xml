Since we both smoke we were given an unrenovated room (with kitchenette) on the 1st floor by the pool, which was great as I use a wheelchair didn't have to always wait for a mostly empty elevator. Speaking of the elevators, we had a good time going to different floors as many people didn't know how to use their room card correctly to hit the right floor. We heard very little grumbling about the mixups mostly people treated it as an adventure. The staff was great - everything we asked for we received in record time. We tipped housekeeping every day a thank you note was left for us. Our room was large enough to accommodate the wheelchair; it was very clean - no bugs; any dishes left in the sink were washed for us; bell staff were more than kind helpful. As others have stated, the WW is right on the bus line, a short walk to the beach right across from The Pantry, which has everything anyone could need for their stay. A word of warning, if you eat at Chili's, dress warmly as the temperature is somewhere around freezing, but the food is worth it. Can't wait to return next year! Aloha!!!
