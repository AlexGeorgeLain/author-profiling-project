The service was exceptional (especially Heather the concierge, who advised us on the best places to go to). We had room 738 a corner room over looking the street, the room was very large for a city centre hotel. The room was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable that we have ever slept in.I would recommend this hotel to everyone wanting to visit Boston.If you get a chance go to Grill 23 across the road from the hotel, best steaks you will ever have.
