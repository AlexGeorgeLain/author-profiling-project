It's exactly as pictured and described on the hotel website (and in tripadvisor traveler photos), with beautifully decorated rooms, as well as air-conditioning, a refrigerator and safe in the room, and pleasant, helpful people at the front desk. Our room faced the street, yet was very quiet when the windows were closed.The location couldn't be better: within walking distance of a largenumber of tourist sites (Eiffel tower, the Seine, Rue Cler, Invalides + Napoleon's Tomb, Rodin Museum, Place de la Concorde, Pont Alexandre, Champs d'Elysees, Tuileries, etc) yet the immediate surroundings are not touristy; one has the feeling of being in a typical Parisian neighborhood. There was a wonderful boulangerie a couple doors down; also on the same block were a pharmacy, a veg/fruit shop, and a small grocery store. The Paris metro is only 1/2 block away; the RER (railroad, e.g., for trips to Versailles or Vincennes Chateaux or to CDG airport) stop is about 10 min walk. We would definitely stay here again!
