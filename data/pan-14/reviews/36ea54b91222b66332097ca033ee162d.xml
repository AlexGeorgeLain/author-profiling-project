We were three women on a shopping spree and the doormen were so heplful when we arrived with our shopping., especially Christopher. also Ronaldo for getting us a taxi to the theater. Like all the other reviews no complaints with the housekeeping or reception they were excellent. The area itself it so safe with the Murray hill market just at the corner for stocking up on water, milk etc. Will definitely go back to the Affinia Dumont.
