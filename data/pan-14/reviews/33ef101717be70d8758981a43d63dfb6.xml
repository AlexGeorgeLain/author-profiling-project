When you step out of the hotel, you are at the entrance to Plaza Mayor. I thought the hotel location was very convenient for my sightseeing. The hotel staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. The buffet style breakfast was good. The room and bathroom were clean and efficient. A/C in the room worked fine and helped me a lot in that hot weather. My overall experience at this hotel was excellent for such a low room rate! The only thing I would like to see improved is a cover for the bed. The blanket I used to sleep looked somewhat old. If the hotel put some cover for that kind of blanket, the impression would have been much better. My room faced the road Atocha and the noise from the traffic was quite loud. Next time I would ask for a room in the back.
