I booked this hotel before I checked the reviews( I know thats the wrong thing to do) but in this case we would have missed a good hotel if we had paid attention to the bad reviews. Everything worked for us. The reception staff were polite, the breakfast was plentiful, the room was very clean and comfortable with a great shower in bathroom. Everything we needed for our short stay. Yes the hotel is being redecorated and the workmen are in but they tend to work in the evening and they are making the hotel look even better. We had a room looking over an alley and we were not disturbed by anyone during the night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a great location and a pleasant stay.
