The staff is the most friendly and helpful of any hotel I have stayed in anywhere (seriously). The rooms are large enough and have all the conveniences needed. Our daughter accompanied us on this trip and they arranged for her to have a room right next to ours with a view of the patio and the River. For Florence it is also a great value with rates that are less than other hotels of equal or lesser value. There is also a small grocery store just down the block in case you need anything or feel like eating in. It is away from the noisey and touristy center of Florence but close enough to walk anywhere of interest. Also, cabs are fairly reasonably priced should you tire of walking. All things considered, a great place to stay in Florence.
