I was celebrating my 40th birthday and the staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant in suggesting options (we plumped for a day trip to San Gimnignano Siena - very good and arranged via the hotel in nanoseconds). Despite our plane landing an hour late, our hotel shuttle was waiting for us right outside arrivals. The room was spotless and a free pillow menu meant we could order our respective types of pillows (I'm a down girl - he's a firm man) to ensure that we slept like babies every night. A free welcome drink in the bar was offered and we chose to eat in one night which proved excellent also. Very good breakfast served until 10.30 with full English Continental on offer. Good online access and a 15 minute walk to the Duomo Uffizi means that this ticks every box. Bravo!
