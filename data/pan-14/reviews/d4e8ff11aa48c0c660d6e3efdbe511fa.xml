This lovely hotel is on a small, quiet one-way street, and rooms on the opposite side of the property overlook the beautiful Arno. Despite the tranquil location, however, you're only a block and a half from the Ponte Vecchio and other major tourist attactions. The rooms in this 15th century palazzo are spacious, comfortable, and furnished with elegant antiques. Owners Anna and Andrea Gennarini speak accomplished English and will make you feel completely at home during your stay. They will also tell you about excellent nearby restaurants and off-the-beaten-path sites of interest. But their willingness to make your stay special doesn't end there. Recently, when some young friends of ours stayed at Hotel Alessandra on their honeymoon, I e-mailed Andrea asking him to do something special for them, and he came up with a thoughtful, creative way to comply with my request. After staying at Hotel Alessandra, you'll feel like you have old family friends in Florence, and you'll want to return to this haven again and again!
