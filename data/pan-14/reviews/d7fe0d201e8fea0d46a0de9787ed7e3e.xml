We were upgraded to a higher floor after complaining about the smell in our first room. Same room, just a higher floor with no bad smell. The bathroom was clean. The cleaning service was fine. I don't really have any complaints about the hotel. I just expected a lot since it was rated so highly on this web site. I don't think it was worth the extra money we paid. I think we could have gotten just as nice a room for less. It is in a good location.
