Well positioned across the road from the train station and only one stop into the city. Also handy to the ferry. After a slight hiccup at check in (they had my name correct but wrong address) our Aqua room was fine, with a great view of the harbour. Some reviewers have had problems with musty rooms but our was OK, also the furniture was not scratched or knocked about as some have reported. It is probably worth upgrading to the water view rooms as they seem better maintained. The aircon was efficient and very quiet (although it will not work until a room key is inserted into a slot - get two keys at check-in so you can leave one in the slot while you are out).The bathroom is small but nicely tiled. A potential problem for those travelling by car is that the car park (extra cost) is small and you are not guaranteed a spot. If the car park is full you have to park down the street at another parking station about 6-7 minutes walk, and back up a hill. We got the best deal by calling the hotel directly (better than their own website). This hotel is definately not five star, but at the price we paid it was fair value. It represents a good alternative to higher priced hotels right in the city yet is well served by public transport, even a taxi rank at the door.
