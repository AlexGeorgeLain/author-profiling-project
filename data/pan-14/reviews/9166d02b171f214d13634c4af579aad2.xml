Pool area is a bit bland and windy and the location isn't great, but thankfully taxis in Singapore are cheap and plentiful. If you are used to the Oriental group hotels you won't be disappointed. This lives up to it's reputation, without the wow factor. Spa is bland but therapists are fantastic!

Location isn't for everyone, being very far downtown with few proper shopping/eating options. Room itself was pretty nice - standard modern Hilton. Staff were a bit snooty. I was woken up every 15 minutes as my room was next to the elevator, so the ding was annoying, and there was a housekeeping phone right outside the room that kept ringing. Staff comment was Oh, would you like us to shut down the elevator then?However - one thing to bear in mind that the hotel overlooks Ground Zero. Directly. In fact, you probably won't get a better view of the site of the fallen twin towers from anywhere. Maybe it's just me, but I found it a rather disturbing sight. Of course some people will find this interesting. I just found it was chilling.
