We did not swim or have a meal in the evening there but if the Breakfast was anything to go by then I feel the evening meal would be excellant too. Very clean well comfy beds with our room looking down directly onto a busy street (we were on the 6th floor) but as the room is double glazed not a sound was heard.Lift or stairs took you to where you wanted to be. Attentive helpful staff an excellent position to the main square of Placa Catalunya The Rambla.(wow what a place)We could fully recommend Barcelona as a vibrant alive place,colourful not to be missed. We mostly tried to eat where the locals did found that the city has more to offer than just paella. Very easy to get to via the airport bus on arrival we found many helpful locals whenever we stopped to check our map! The biggest asset for us were very comfortable walking shoes. We would happily stay in Mont Blanc again
