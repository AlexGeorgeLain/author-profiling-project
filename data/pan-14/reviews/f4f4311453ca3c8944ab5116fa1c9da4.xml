We needed a relatively inexpensive place with a room for 4. We were quite pleased with the Luna Simone. The beds were quite comfortable, even though the room was very small (didn't bother us). We loved being so close to Victoria Station because we wanted to tour lots of places within London, plus we picked up our rental car for the rest of our trip there. The bathroom was clean and sufficient (why do I always forget that the British don't use washcloths so I could bring my own?). The only drawback was the breakfast--minimal choice and rather cheaply made, I thought, especially compared to later places we stayed.
