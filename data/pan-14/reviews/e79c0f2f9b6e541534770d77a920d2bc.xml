The Hotel Antiche Figure is wonderful, particularly if you are taking a cruise from Venice, or arriving by ship to Venice. It is a short water taxi ride to the Piazza Roma, and then a five minute shuttle bus ride to the pier. The hotel staff is friendly and accomodating in every way. There is no reason to spend more money elsewhere. This is great value in a great location. Ask for a Grand Canal view room. You will not be disappointed.
