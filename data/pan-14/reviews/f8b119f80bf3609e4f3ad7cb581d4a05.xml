The only thing we missed were English tv-channels, everything else is excellent. Our room was big and beautyifully furnished, and the staff was always very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is not included in the price but it was worth every penny of the 13 euros. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the Rambla on foot and there are loads of nice bars and restaurants in the area. We are definetely coming back!
