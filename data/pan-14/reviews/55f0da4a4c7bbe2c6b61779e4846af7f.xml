From the moment we arrived, we were hugely impressed with the standard of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. Everything worked and was of the highest quality, from the excellent room to the best ever pool I've seen.When I lost my camera, the hotel manager arranged for the head of security to accompany me to the police station, a requirement of my travel insurance but not something I fancied taking on myself. Less than an hour later, I had a police report which should allow the claim to proceed.Contrary to other reviews on this site, we found the food at the Conrad to be really very good. OK so you can get it cheaper elsewhere and there are more authentic Balinese restaurants available (the Bumbu Bali is five minutes away by car and they collect and return you!), but for a luxury hotel in impeccable surroundings, the cost and quality of the food offering is in my experience hard to beat.I look forward to my next trip to the Conrad Bali - I'd recommend it highly to anyone!
