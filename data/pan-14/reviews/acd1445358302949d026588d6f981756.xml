The staff could not be warmer or friendlier. Since it is a small hotel and small staff you see the same faces. They were helpful with nearby restaurants, hotel services etc. They really seemed to want you to enjoy your stay....which I found appealing and unusual for NYC.The breakfast of cereal, cheese, yogurt, danish etc. was terrific. They have an automatic cappucino maker that I was crazy for...the afternoon wine and cheese made a wonderful stop to meet new and interesting people. You certainly could be solitary if you chose to, but the guests were super interesting. Most people wanted to share that they too, thought this is a great hotel.Our room was quite stunning and immaculate. It was a suite sized room with a sofa seating area. It was a corner room, which was very nice. After a crazy hectic day in NYC we looked forward to returning to THE LIBRARY.

They loved all the action in the lobby and in Union Square.We were able to get a last minute room for under $150.00. The room in the newer part of the hotel was quite nice. It was more spacious than other San Francisco 4 star hotels in S.F. The only negative was the shower lever falling off in my hand. The room was very clean and quiet. I was a little disappointed that they did not have umbrellas to use in the rain storm, as many hotels do in S.F. The staff apologized and sent us to Walgreens down the street.Overall we enjoyed our stay and for that price we will stay there again.
