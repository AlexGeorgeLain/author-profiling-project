Good location, plenty of parking (rather expensive, but hey, it's San Francisco). Clean, comfortable room. Extremely dirty windows, which is a pitty, as the view would be quite interesting. Diverse crowd of people in the hotel, quite a few European tourists. Staff is very professional and helpful. Hotel is very close to Union Street which is just loaded with cute restaurants, wine bars, bistros and boutiques. All in all, good value for the money.
