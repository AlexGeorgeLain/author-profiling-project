On the other hand everything is clean and service is friendly and accommodating. The most spectacular thing is the view. We had a room on the top floor and were looking at the scenery all the time. Large panoramic windows make it possible. Don't be afraid of noise; hotel is well insulated. We thought the new mattresses were too soft, others will maybe enjoy them: a matter of personal taste. What's not a matter of taste is the extremely low water pressure in the bathrooms. Bathrooms, by the way, are larger than usual and have all amenities. Not in working condition was the advertised feature of check-out via your TV screen. Also, the promised quick check-out bill was not under our front door. We had to go downstairs and stand in line. Cashier did not pay proper attention to people in line at the Preferred Guest Counter (a problem found in a lot of Starwood hotels). Overall we enjoyed our stay and would come back to the Sheraton Gateway.
