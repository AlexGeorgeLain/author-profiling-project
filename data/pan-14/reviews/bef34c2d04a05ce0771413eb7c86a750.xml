The hotel was quite trendy with comfortable rooms. I was really impressed with the size of the flat screen TV provided in the room that I stayed at. The room was spacious and comfortable offering all of the normal amenities. The only downside to this hotel is there is no sports gym attached to the hotel. It is a 5 minute walk to the California Sports Club which the hotel has a relationship with. Mornings were not busy. I would recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure.

The location of the hotel is great. Located near major business districts. Rooms were comfortable. I was suprised though at the level of service. Paying almost 1000 USD for the room for a night I thought the service level was average. Being on the Club Floor I was surprised at how little interaction there was with the staff. I thought they would be a little more helpful during the stay. Overall, if it weren't for the views I wouldn't pay that much money again for the room. The service level of the staff could be brought up a little higher.
