We found this hotel after looking on the top ten hotels for Amsterdam on Trip Advisor and are we glad that we did!If you're stupidly homophobic or a complete prude then this isn't the place for you... for us? It was great fun! and if we go back to Amsterdam we'll certainly be booking again.I booked it for our Wedding Anniversary (yes we are straight! and not into the leather scene!) but having read the reviews and visiting the hotel website, we were convinced we would have a nice time!Its is located about 2 minute walk from the train station, and is within walking distance to everything thats of interest in Amsterdam central.The hotel is alongside a canal and is very unassuming from the outside, you have to count the numbers to know its the right one!On arrival we were warmly met by Jurrich who booked us in and served us a beer and gave us a good idea on the map as to where everything was located...We stayed in Room 12 (classic room) and oh what a room!Its gorgeously decorated, the bed was sumptuous and huge! everything was spotlessley clean (theres not many places we have stopped in that can claim this), there's also a CD player, DVD and TV, a very well stocked mini bar, a safe...The bathroom was just as lovely, a double bath, walk in shower...... oh i almost forgot... and a cage!!!The breakfast is normally 10 - 12, which trust me after a late night out in Amsterdam its fabulous to have a lie in and not miss breakfast.... and what a breakfast it was! This far surpasses anything we have had previously on the continent.Theres fresh fruit salad, yoghurts, cheeses, ham, all types of fresh breads, including nice soft stuff perfect for toasting, lots of different types of jams, honey etc, fresh coffee, tea and orange juice, but the best bit was Jurrichs bacon and eggs....All in all we have never stopped in a better hotel and Jurrich and Onno should be very proud of the standards they have set!
