		<document id="3cbe9d5d0aeebc19dab24351d49bc807" url=""><![CDATA[a hidden gem Booked our stay after reviews on trip advisor and was not disappointed !The hotel is in a great location, with lots of restuarants and cafes in very close proximity.Felt very safe wandering the streets at nite,Los Ramblas a 5 min. stroll away.The hotel is very quaint, filled with olde worlde charm,lots of antique style fittings and furnishings,yes, the rooms are compact, but found the bed very comfortable, and the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean,Staff very helpful, a lovely young man came down to greet us and carried bags upstairs late at nite,Would definitiely return here, very good value for money for the location,But if it is a 5 star hotel with all the bells and whistles you require, this hotel is not for you,Our only complaint was when we were ready to go to the airport!Lovely young lady at reception insisted on calling a cab for us,then she was adamant that she needed to accompany us downstairs to talk to the driver,My partner saw a bank note exchange hands from driver to receptionist??, and when we arrrived at the airport our fare was 10 euros more than our arrival fare??Would suggest you go downstairs and hail your own cab,Only a minor hiccup but dont like to be taken for a ride, so to speak!!
