I cannot say enough good things about our time there. With the help of the wonderful concierge Margo, my husband was able to surprise me by having local cheese and wine waiting in our room on arrival; on her own, Margo had added some chocolate and a lovely bouquet. Margo also arranged reservations for two fantastic dinners (Palisade and the Waterfront Seafood Grill) during our time there. The staff--from the front desk to housekeeping to valets--were all extremely courteous and attentive. Our view, which looked out on Elliott Bay, was magnificent, and the room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. I enjoyed the modern decor of the hotel. Very convenient location, just down from Pike's Place and right across from a free shuttle that goes to Pioneer Square. We had a perfectly wonderful stay and look forward to returning sometime.
