We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of a guided tour through northern France and this was our favorite hotel by far! It's in a great part of town, away from the busiest parts of town but accessible to the Metro and cool, less busy things to do. The room was so comfortable with fabulous down comforters and overall was a great place to rest our heads for a couple nights. I wish all of the hotels on the tour were this great. I recommend this hotel with no hesitation!!
