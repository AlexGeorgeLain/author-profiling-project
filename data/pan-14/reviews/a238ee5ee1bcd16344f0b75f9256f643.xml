Despite having breakfast vouchers from our travel agent, they refused to accept them and stated that when our room was booked it did not state breakfast, so we had to pay for our breakfasts and seek reimbursement from the agents on our return. And to top it off they lost my pajamas!. My white pajamas were left on top of my bed when I returned to my room after breakfast our bed had been made up and I only discovered the loss when I needed them at night. I reported it to reception who appeared uninterested and said they would report it. I never did get my pajamas back. I would not have minded so much if at any point I got any apology or an acknowledgement of the loss but the reception staff appeared unconcerned and unhelpful. They have notices in the bathroom to request that guests do not remove property from the hotel or it will be charged to your account, no reimbursement was given for my pajamas! This is very unfortunate as it is located at a very good spot.
