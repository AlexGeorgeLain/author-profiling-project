The pool was OK but don't buy a drink from the pool bar, the prices are very expensive as is the bar next to reception. The buffet breakfast was good with all tastes catered for but had to wait for some things to be cooked. Our breakfast was included in room rate don't think I would have paid extra for it as was quite expensive. Think I would try a different hotel when next in Singapore
