There is one chair in the room, with a desk, telephone/alarm clock/radio and lamps on each side of the bed. Light swiches for the main ceiling light are located next to the room door, and on one side of the bed. A kettle is supplied, as well as tea, coffee, sugar and milk. Windows are not open-able, but the rooms have air conditioning, with a swich where the room temperature can be set. The television has 6 channels: 7, 9, 10, ABC, SBS and a Tourist Channel. Pay per view movies are available for $14.95 each as well as 4 adult channels. The bathroom has a small shower, with a clothesline which is placeable between the walls of the shower. There is also a regular sized sink and a hair dryer.A small fridge that is empty (no mini-bar when I stayed there) is located under the TV.Then the usual you would expect from a hotel: About 5 towels of different sizes, 2 small bars of good quality soap, 1 packet of shampoo, 1 packet of conditioner, shower cap and a sanitary bag. An iron and a large ironing board are also supplied as well as an extra blanket.I loved this hotel and I would definately stay in it again in the future.
