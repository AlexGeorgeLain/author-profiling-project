The hotel is in a great location! Walking distance from the train station (5 min) and all the main attractions. The staff were very friendly and always chatty and welcoming. The rooms are average really, a little worn down but clean and comfortable. I would recommend the hotel for a short stay as your really only going to be in there for sleep and for that its fine! However, please note that Internet Access is not free and they charge a tourist tax upon checkout as well
