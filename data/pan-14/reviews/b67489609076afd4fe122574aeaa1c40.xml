We paid 100 a night on priceline and it was worth it, right near seattle center where you can also take the monorail to downtown. The showers had great water pressure. My only complaint would be the pillows. 2 flat pillows is not acceptable. They should either have 2 good ones or 4 pillows. We asked for 2 pillows and they were brought up to us. It was a minor thing, we would definitely stay again. We did not eat breakfast there so I cannot comment on that.

I did not care for the minimalist decor, lack of air conditioning, and lack of window screen. The website does not specifiy that there is only a/c in the rooms with bathrooms, so that is misleading. But I had a travel fan and kept the window open and it was fine. They turned off the hall light at 10pm, but this may be a bit late for east coast travelers like me. It is bright in the room until the hall light is turned off, but I'm sure they would turn it of earlier if asked. Good things-- The staff is super friendly and helpful. They carried my luggage up the stairs and back down again when I left. The beakfast is great and the setup is nice. The breakfast room has milk, orange juice, toast and jam, yogurt, granola and fruit. There are also trays so you can take it back to your room and a flat screen tv to watch. The bed and pillows were very comftorable and I really liked the bathrooms and the mint shampoo/conditioner. If I was traveling alone I would consider the Ace again. If they added some color to the decor it would be nicer I think.

The food is very good from the restaurant. The steak and sexy fries are especially good. I would definitely return to this hotel, probably without a car to park though. Once you get past the cost, it is a great hotel. They often have special offers, we paid about $200 a night in August. I loved the atmosphere, the Bliss products, and the room. Microsuede couch, comftorable bed, plasma tv with dvd player. It was nice after a long day to order room service and watch a movie. They also have an extensive library of cds, movies, and newspapers. We did not take advantage of this but the pay per view movie list was also convenient and featured new releases. When we checked in they had popsicles in ice buckets sitting out. Nice touch.All of the staff is very friendly and helpful. They will bend over backwards to keep you happy. Anytime I called down for something, it was taken care of right away. The person who took our luggage out of the taxi accidentally left a small bag in there. We noticed it that night and got the run around from the cab company. We talked to someone at the front desk the next day, and within an hour the hotel had my bag back. Our luggage was loaded and unloaded for us so we didnt even have to bother with it. Taxis are waiting outside the hotel so you do not have to call one. Overall staying at this hotel was one of the nicer parts of our vacation.
