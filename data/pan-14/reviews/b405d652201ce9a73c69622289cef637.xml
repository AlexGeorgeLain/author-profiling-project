The staff were very helpful and friendly answering and helping when asked. The only thing I could criticize is the charge you have to pay per day for self parking and the price they charge for food and mixed drinks. We did rent a car so we cut cost by both eating and drinking outside the resort every evening. We followed fellow advisor advice on that. The best restaurant by far we thought was Riche's just above the resort. Every thing we had along with the service was excellent. We traveled everyday to see the different towns and to El Yunque. Was not impressed with Yunque but it was crowded and we did not try to fight the tour crowds. Old San Juan was nice but not my cup of tea. We played at several of the local casino's along with the one at the resort and all were small but lots of fun and we did win...........................The beach at the resort was very nice even thought the water was pretty cool. Lots of room to walk or lounge.Overall this was one of the nicer Wyndham resorts that we have stayed and would reccommend.
