Yes, it isn't the newest built hotel in barcelona but everything is there that you need. Its big point is of course it sits on top of the metro which is great for cross city jaunts or getting to-and-from airports. A word of warning though, the metro finishes at midnight during the summer (earlier in the winter) and since you don't really eat dinner in Spain till 9-10, you will probably find yourself hailing a taxi/bus to get home - its a bit of a walk unless your near the new city area - slightly inconvenient. Staff are friendly and helpful. You can do a lot lot worse.
