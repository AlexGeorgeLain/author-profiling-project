They were right! Beautiful, comfortable rooms, elegant lobby. Free internet off to the left of the lobby, in their business center (they have the computers, you don't have to have your own) and a large, very nice sitting room. Concierge and front desk were great. Restaurant on the high priced side (what hotel isn't) but exceptional and memorable. Crab Flatbread, strawberry rhubarb shortcake, gnocchi, salads, steak, all magnificent and original. Would absolutely be my first choice if I ever go to Boston again.
