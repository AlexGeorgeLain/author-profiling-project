Amazingly all my expectations were met and more.We spent 3 nights at the Pulitzer and it was wonderful. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was included and great. We enjoyed a beautiful meal in the restaurant and were disappointed that it only has limited opening. This is a wonderful boutique hotel; the rooms are a bit small but wonderfully laid out, decorated and maintained. The roof top terrace is fantastic for relaxing in the late summer/early autumn evenings.My wife and I can fully recommend the romantic celebration. It was a bit of fun which added to the celebration of our 20th wedding anniversary. It is a lovely touch and well worth the small charge.While we did have a problem, the staff and management worked to resolve it and in the end we were satisfied with how it was handled.Overall this is an excellent hotel and I cannot recommend it highly enough; location, cleanliness, quality, all in all a wonderful base from which to enjoy Barcelona.
