I asked the cook if he would eat that but he did'nt understand English, so all I got was that blank stare.If you want service, it is nonexistant, the natives are a nuisance hawking there wares.The room was in disrepair although the maid did an excellent job keeping it clean.We took one tour into Santo Domingo which was 3 hours away and travelling through the country gave me the impression that the Dominicans don't have much pride in their country, at any openspace where there were'nt any buildings, is where they threw their trash and I mean everywhere.I could go on,but You should be able to tell that I would'nt go back
