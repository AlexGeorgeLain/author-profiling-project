We were part of a large wedding, and we were part of the Club Golden package. With having read recent poor reviews of the Gran Bahia, my wife and I thought we should come to the defense of this awesome resort. The rooms, the grounds, and the facilities are immaculate and clean. We were very pleased not only with the a la carte restaurants, but the buffets as well. But above all, the staff made our stay truly memorable. They were friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable. On our first day, we found the safe was inoperable. A technician was at our room within 10 minutes of our phone call being placed and fixed it within minutes. Great service.While we were there, we did see some folks upset about the smallest thing. The poor staff were shouted at and verbally abused. Please people, relax, you are not in your home country, things may not go as well as things back home, but your stay will be better if you relax.An example, we overheard staff getting reamed out from the smell from the storm drainage area (aka swamp). My gawd people, you are in the tropics. Relax!Our favourite a la carte was the Mediterranean, with a close 2nd the Brazilian.This is a very large resort, so if you want quaint and private this is not the resort for you. On the other hand the size offers, great restaurant selection, many pools, a large beach area, and lots of choices.The Dominican people are wonderful, friendly and obviously enjoy there work. Their pride shined thru!
