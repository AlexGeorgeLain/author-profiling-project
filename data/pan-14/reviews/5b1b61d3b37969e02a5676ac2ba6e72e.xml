The hotel itself was quiet nice as it is relatively new. The lobbby area is nice offering complementary coffee/ juice and cookies. The staff were exceptionally friendly and very cheerfull. The room was average but very clean with new furniture. A iron and board/ hairdryer and coffee making facilities were included in the room as well. One good thing I noticed was that each floor had its own laundry facilities. The main drawback was its location. It was great for walking to the Key areana and Seattle Centre which is where the Space Needle is but if you wanted to go shopping downtown or find a decent place to eat you had to drive a long ways. The hotel is not really in the downtown area. It is still at least a 15 minute drive to Pioneer Square and to shopping in the downtown retail district. The hotel is almost like its located in a residential type area. The free continental breakfast was excellent and really looked forward to it every morning. I would reccommend this property to anyone who is visiting the city to see a concert at the Key Arena as it is only a 5 minute walk there. For those planning to shop downtown and enjoy the nightlife I would reccommend you stay closer to the downtown city centre.
