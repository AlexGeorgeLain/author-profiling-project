Nothing seems to be too much trouble to get the answer to any question or queryThe rooms are spotlessly clean and Breakfast in the courtyard is very Romantic.While we were there it was rather wet so it gave them a chance to try out their new covered area.It worked very well so even if it's wet you can still have their wonderful breakfast outside.I would recommend this hotel unreservedly from our experiences
