We enjoyed the space and the free water provided by the hotel in our refrigerator.The location could not have been better. We could walk everywhere. The hotel staff was extremely helpful. They could not do enough for us. The hotel even provided 2 computers for free internet service. The restaurant in the hotel was excellent and not pricey. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel since there were many options nearby.We highly recommend this hotel.
