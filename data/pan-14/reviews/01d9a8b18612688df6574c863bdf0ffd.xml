The rooms are kept very clean and the service is top notch. What I personally like about this resort is that it is not so huge as to be intimidating. You get to know the staff , who are very friendly and accomodating in every way. I really felt relaxed and quite at ease. There were ampel chairs around the pool as well as at the beach. Towels were plentifull. The food was very good and the variety was exceptional.
