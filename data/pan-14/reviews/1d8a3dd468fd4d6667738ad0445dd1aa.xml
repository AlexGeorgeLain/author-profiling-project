Although predominently a business hotel well situated in a quiet area on Diagonal Ave in central Barcelona. Just a couple of blocks from the nearest metro, within 20mins walk of Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Whilst we loved the buzz of Las Ramblas we were very pleased not to be staying in a hotel in the middle of all the bustle. The rooms are modern and very well appointed, with efficient friendly service. Did not eat at the hotel as there are several tapas bars, cafes etc within easy reach of the hotel. Would recommend, especially if there are deals available.
