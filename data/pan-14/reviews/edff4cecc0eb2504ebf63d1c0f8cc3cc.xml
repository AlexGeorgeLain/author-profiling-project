Union Square overall is a nice area, but I'd say the Hyatt by Fisherman's wharf might be better in terms of location. Union square is primarily all shopping of name brand stores. Powell street is close by though and you can get the cable car rides easily from this hotel and several bus lines close by as well if you don't rent a car. Hotel parking is expensive though, almost $50 for overnight and overall the location lacks in places to eat. Great hotel, not the greatest locatio!
