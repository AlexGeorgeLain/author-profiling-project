The hotel was very clean, service excellent and the Japanesse and Patio restaurants also excellent. Very friendly staff all around. Once you have registered you notice that everything is all open and on one floor with 4 elevators to the rooms. The floral arrangements were beautiful throughout the grounds. Nice view of the harbor with a distant view or the ocean. Sunsets were very enjoyable from the patio area. Hawaiian entertainment on Thurs, Fri. and Sat. evening and also fireworks on Friday. Car rental on site and also hotel is located on the bus route. Many restaurants in the immediate area. About $5.00 taxi to mid town Waikiki beaches. Two weeks were not enough for this balmy island.
