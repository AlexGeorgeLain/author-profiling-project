Its definitely worth checking out as for the price it does give value for money. Its nothing fancy, in fact you think you are going into a block of apartments when you enter. You have to go to the third floor to get to reception, but we were given a room on the first floor which is in a separate annex to the hotel. This part of the hotel has been recently refurbished so the room was clean and modern. They also had wooden shutters on the windows which blocked out all light at night, something I find very beneficial when trying to sleep in hotels. There was some outside noise from the street at night mainly from street cleaning machines but as it is in the centre of town some noise would be expected. In fact its in a very good location. Its 2 mins walk from the Duomo, 5 mins from the Uffizi and about 10 mins walk to the train station. Breakfast is the usual continental buffet style - bread rolls, cereal, cheese etc. There are also free internet access until 12 midnight. The staff at reception were very courteous and helpful
