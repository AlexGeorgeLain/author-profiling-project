Room average size, bed comfy. Bathroom average - not cramped. Had a rear of hotel room so didnt get any street noise, was on the dark side, but as i wasnt getting in until 2 or 3 am it wouldnt have mattered and only used the room to shower and sleep. Aircon great and was necessary - 30c during day in the shade and 24c at midnight!. Strange really old fashioned decor and covers on furniture, but all adding to a rather strange charm. Buffet style breakfast - mainly consisting of bread, fruit juice coffee, boiled eggs and cereals. No cooked stuff such as sausages or bacon. But absolutely fine. Great city, lots to do. Dont take any valuables out with you where at all possible, just leave them in your room safe at night. I would post some pictures except I had my camera stolen (pick pocketed) on the second night. They probably thought it was my wallet, but all my cash was double pinned in the lower pockets of ny shorts. I think they used the old diversion tactic of brushing againt you so that you notice them knocking into you, while they help themselves to the contents of your pocket. Still had a good holiday though.
