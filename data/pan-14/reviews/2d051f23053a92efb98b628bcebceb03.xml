Based on my experiences staying at five different Four Season's previously, the Singapore hotel falls a bit short. It is still a grand and excellently run hotel. However, the Premium room that I got was not up to other Four Season's standards and the view out the corner windows was quiite ugly at both views. I may be a bit picky, but as highly rated and as relatively expensive this hotel is, it should be perfect as, I found, was the case at the Four Season's in New York and Paris for instance. The policy of all Four Seasopn's of charging between $10 and $20 extra for high speed internet access is downright foolish on their part. Instead of charging $600 or $800. for a room, charge $610 or $810 and forgo the embarrassing surcharge for what should surely be part of the room rate.

We love hotels in this chain and have stayed in six different ones this year alone. The deluxe room was tight. Not near the space we have grown to expect from the Four Seasons. Bathroon only so-so; you actaully had to squirm to close the door in the toilet area of the bathroom. The elevator system is quite complex with changes necessary to get from the entrance to your room. Personnel, although friendly was sloppy and not as helpful as one expects from this excellent group of hotels. We wiull probably try something different the next time in SF.
