But, in fact, my opinion on this hostal is a little bit different from the compliments. I think this hostal is good only to the single budget travellers. Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad hostel. But, it is not right to be ranked to be this high as ranked 6. This is not right. I don't recommend this hostel for family. It has superb location, I agree on this, it is no doubt. It is cheap for singles. I stayed in a tripple room since I had a child. But, the extra bed was nearly falling down. The bed had terrible smell and the hostel poured perfume to hide it, I noticed this is very common in cheap hostels in spain. The other problem is their central heating system. If it is too cold, well, there is nothing you can do. Just wear more clothes. The only feature that we really loved was the free Wi-Fi. But, next time I would stay better place. Overall, this is not a bad hostel but you get what you paid for. Recommend only for the budget single travellers. Never to the family with children and old parents.
