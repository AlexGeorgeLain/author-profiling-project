I read the reviews on here before I booked and I was a little unsure how the trip was going to go. After staying there....I'm not sure what all the negative people are talking about. This place was pretty nice. The hotel was historic and had a great feel to it. The location was perfect and the staff was friendly. The rooms were small but that is the case with most older hotels. I did have a problem with the in room safe being locked when we checked in. They told me there is nothing they can do but they did offer to use a lock box at the counter. You may also want to note the $30 a day parking charge. Overall I was pretty happy with the place and I imagine I will go back.
