Hans (the owner) seemed quite gruff but this was really just an act. He was very friendly and helpful, providing restaurant advice and directions. We had to leave at 5:30 a.m. for our flight and he arranged airport transportation for us at quite a good price. The breakfast service was about what you expect in Europe--more than adequate. We would definitely return.
