If some kids stayed there watching video or playing games on the net then good luck.Couple of nights I could hear TV, people talking from next doorand one time people upstairs was moving furniture aroundin the middle of the nite. Though it said Harbour view hotel ; I found it misleading as it is smack bang in the middle of concrete jungle and can hardly see the harbour.To be fair it is not bad for the price location and I would stay there again.
