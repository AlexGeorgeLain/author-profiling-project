Helped with restaurants that were very good. The rooms are very small but that is just Paris. The rooms are clean, the hotel in general was spotless. Breakfast was the best we had in France. Good variety from eggs, cheese, ham, cereal and fruit. Down side is the location in a busy young area. Rooms were quiet enough but the party atmosphere goes on until the wee hours of the morning. Overall, I would definitely stay at the Albe again.
