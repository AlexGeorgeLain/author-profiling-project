We enjoyed the hotel and the people that operate the facility.. It is kept in the most beautiful condition and the location is perfect for walking. We had originally planned staying at a different hotel when we returned to Paris but we enjoyed Luxembourg Parc that we stayed there again and enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed it the first time
