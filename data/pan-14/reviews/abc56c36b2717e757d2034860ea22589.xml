However, the music, whether from the adjacent Nuyorican club, or from the bar in the alley, went on until about 3 AM almost every day I was there. I wore earplugs, but they couldn't block the sound of a trumpet in the alley at 2:30 one morning. Also, there's no elevator, so be prepared to carry your bags up four flights of stairs if you stay on the top level (the one with the terrace). The owner and the staff are very nice and friendly, though, and partying twenty-somethings likely would love the place.
