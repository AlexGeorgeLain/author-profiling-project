Room was nice with decent view although room was very small in my opinion, Restaurant food was alright but $130 for 2 people to eat dinner seriously? the steak we ordered wasnt any better than ordering a steak from say Chili's. so we didnt eat there again, went across the street to the Hilton the next night and ate in the restaurant that was on the very top, 47th floor I believe, Amazing views and spectacular food, did plenty of sightseeing and shopping and in the end, San Francisco is just not my kind of place really, I think I like southern California alot better, temps. werent that warm, nothing really exciting about S.F. had a good time but really nothing special, definetely will go back to Orange County/LA area next time I want to go to california.
