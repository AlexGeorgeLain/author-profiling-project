The room was fantastic with high ceilings and fantastic furniture and the bathroom was large and everywhere spotlessly clean! The location is great - you can walk to everywhere you want to, and the area has some of the best shops and restaurants. The hotel also has a small courtyard garden where you can have breakfast when the weather is nice and the Owners are friendly, helpful and always there if you have any questions. Would definitely recommend this Hotel and would definitely stay there again if we go back to Venice.
