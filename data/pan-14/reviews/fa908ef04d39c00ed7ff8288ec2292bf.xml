It involved a 40 min tram ride and cost lots of euros each time. The area in which it is placed is a nice one but there is a park by the hotel where teenagers congregate at night and create a lot of noise until after midnight,which does not help when you are trying to get to sleep.The hotel is also on the take off path for Schipol Airport which means even more disturbed sleep. There is no air conditioning which means that in extremely hot weather windows had to be opened wide letting in the noise of aircraft and rowdy teenagers! Beware of the ancient lift which is like a 'dumb waiter' anywhere else in the world this lift would be in a museum! The food was good and the staff OK. I rate this as distinctly average. Be careful to add extra for the local tax (some idea of the actual cost before hand would have been helpful). Be aware of an Internet Booking Charge added to your bill as well! Why? We did not use the internet at the hotel we only booked by internet from home.
