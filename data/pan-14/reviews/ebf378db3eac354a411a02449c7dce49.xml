Everything within Florence that we wanted to see, was in walking distance of the hotel. The staff were always friendly during our stay. The breakfast was well worth having. If you do have the breakfast, try and sit outside on the terrace for more of an italian feeling to the morning.The room was basic (as we expected for the price) but clean. The carpet was stained however we were never really in the room other than to sleep, so this did not bother us one bit.The air conditioning was there all the time if we needed it, which was fab, as otherwise it might have been a tad warm.The area where the hotel is located is ok, but there was nothing really to see around it, so walking was always needed. We stayed on the second floor over looking the train station, however the noise never really became an issue, and the views were good from our window... If you can get a higher floor, then try, as i would expect the views to keep on getting better.
