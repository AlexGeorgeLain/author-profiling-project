The pool was fantastic and you could sit and count the planes coming in but not be affected by the noise. We didn't eat in the Hotel except for the inclusive breakfast which was brilliant but ate frequently at the first cafe along where the shops and restaurants were where they did great yum cha and further along at a religious type cafe that did European food which was excellent. We had a local massage in the square which was also brilliant. I couldn't fault the location or the hotel.
