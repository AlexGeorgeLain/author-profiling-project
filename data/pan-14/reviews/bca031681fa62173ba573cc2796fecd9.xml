The staff were very helpful, it was spotlessly clean, the decor was unusual and very striking. We had a room overlooking La Rambla and the sound proofing worked really well. The breakfasts were a real feast - the choice was amazing and everything was topped up really quickly. It was not cheap but it was part of the whole experience. The lounge area has really great seating and just looked so striking. The hot chocolate served at the bar was to die for! I had a really good massage at the Spa and loved the swimming pool and the different features in the pool. The roof top pool was wonderful with views across Barcelona.It would be hard to fault anything - we really hope to go back again.
