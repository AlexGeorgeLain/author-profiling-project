The beach itself is AMAZING, one of the nicest beaches we have ever been to. However, the hotel is the most disgusting trashy hotel I have ever stepped foot in. It is worse than an Econo Lodge. The rooms are dirty and gross. The staff acts like they do not understand English. The line to check in/out was chaos. The food was THE WORST I have ever tasted. I honestly lost about 6 pounds that week. The buffets have flies and birds all over the food. It was the dirtiest thing I have ever seen. The only restaurant with OK food was the Mexican and we did not even discover that until the last night. Please, please, please if you are at all classy and enjoy good food/service, do yourself a favor and do not book this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!
