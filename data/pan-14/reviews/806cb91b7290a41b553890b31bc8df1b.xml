We were given heated, scented towels to freshen our hands and were taken to our lovely room for check-in. We had a partial oceanview room which was mostly oceanview. The beach was beautiful, the restaurants (Shore Bird and Ocean House) were fantastic. The elevator was secure, which was reassuring. The staff was all warm and friendly. Will definitely stay at this hotel again and again!
