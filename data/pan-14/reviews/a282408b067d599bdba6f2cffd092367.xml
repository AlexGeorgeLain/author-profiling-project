The location is in the heart of the city and within walking distance of many tourist attractions as well as easy access to the underground train system.On the first evening we ate in the hotel restuarant and although not busy provided excellent food and service.Now breakfast in this hotel is something else with a choice to be envied by its competitors.We thourghly enjoyed our stay at the Steigenberger and would recommend it to anyone who wishes a memorable stay in Berlin.We just wished we had had a longer time to stay as this hotel has lovely spa facilities which we wished we had time to use.
