It is a beautiful hotel, with a good amount of action at night and a great beach and pool area. However, there are details that I think should be seen to in hotel service, that disappointed me on this trip. Upon arrival, the doormen continued to chat while the 8 of us piled out of a taxi/van, then the woman checking us in could barely be bothered by our presence, but perked up once she realized the amount of money we were spending to stay there. Some of us stayed in the Casitas, which were nice and private, but one day the cleaning staff left the bathroom dirty and the shower drain barely worked. There is a lot of beautiful tile everywhere, which is great, but makes it slippery. My brother fell and no one was around except a staff person, who just looked at him and walked by. My father got the infamous bad beach treatment : he asked for a table and was told by the man who gets your chairs that they were all reserved (they were never used). It appeared that the people who kept handing over money to this man got the best treatment (surprise!). I wrote the manager after this trip and never heard anything (surprise!).
