It has a nice restaurant and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. If you have the money to spend, this would be a great place to stay. The only thing I did not like about this hotel is they make you use their wireless internet service which you have to pay for. If you have dial up capability, it will work for a while, once they learn that you are using free dial up, they will but a block so you can't dial up. Majority of the staff is nice, but when I stayed there, the person who checked me in was absolutely rude. Check out was very smooth and the Grey Hound Bus stops right outside the hotel to take you to the airport...for a fee of course.

Some rooms have an older scent than others but again, it is a decent place to stay. For the last 4 years, I have stayed here and other than some rooms being older than others, I have no complaints. I will stay at this hotel over a pricey one any day. All have kitchenettes so you can cook your own meals, and all rooms have medium size refrigerators. The hotel is only a few blocks away from the beach and in the heart of Waikiki.
