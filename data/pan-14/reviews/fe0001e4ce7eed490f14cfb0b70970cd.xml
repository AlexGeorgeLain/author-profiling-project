The reception staff were friendly, and the facilities in the room worked as expected, including a free safe deposit box and free Internet access both wired and wireless (though the wireless is by accident and not supplied by the hotel).The problems I did run into were unclear information in the service booklet in the room, which mentioned use of the safe costs money. Furthermore, if you want to catch a public bus downtown or to other Oahu attractions you have to walk about 2 blocks. Even the airport shuttle did dropped me a short walk from the hotel entrance.The hotel is several blocks away from both the beach and the conference center, which means you do not need to take a car or bus if you are attending either of these.In all, for $100+tax a night for two double beds, this hotel is satisfactory.
