We (my mum and I )stayed at the Royal Peacock as part of an Intrepid tour and I had read reviews on trip advisor before we left, so I really wasn't looking forward to it. We landed in Singapore very early and so got to the hotel around 8am (check in wasn't until 2pm). We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the reception desk who told us he would try his very best to get at least one room for us to share asap. He offered us complimentary breakfast which we thought was very nice. A room was ready within the hour. The rooms are very very small and cramped. The bathroom is small and not flashy but everything worked okay and it was 'fairly' clean. We eventually got another room (we stayed in one room each, with a single bed, TV, window, small desk and robe. Each room had it's own bathroom). My airconditioner wasn't as effective as the one in my mums room. The noise from the street was quite loud at night but take ear-plugs with you and it will be fine. Breakfast was nice. I think if you don't expect too much this hotel is fine for a very short stay. Other rooms in the hotel may be worse than the ones we had but after reading all of the bad reviews I didn't think it was too bad. If I had a choice I would probably stay somewhere better, but as part of a tour it's okay.
