Enormous rooms, with the added benefit of two balconies - if you dared to go out on them - we were on the 26th floor. Our apartment was very well equipped, making it possible to cook, wash, iron etc. Rooms well serviced each day, by very friendly staff.Reception staff varied, but most were very pleasant. Concierge staff helpful booking taxis etc.Good location - close to the Rocks, Circular Quay, the bridge etc and we did not experience any traffic noise.Supermarket close by, as well as loads of cafes, restaurants etc.Would DEFINITELY stay there again.

Our stay was definitely enhanced by the concierge (Brian) who did an excellent job at ensuring that we got the best out of our visit. He showed interest in how much we had enjoyed his suggestions, and booked us a very reasonable taxi directly back to the airport. (He also taped up our suitcase, which we only discovered to be damaged as we were about to leave!)Our room was fairly compact, though I can't imagine why anyone would want to spend time in a hotel room in this amazing city!Buffet breakfast offered a reasonable selection of items. Other reviews have mentioned problems re lifts - we were on the 9th floor, and did not encounter any delays in using lifts.Hotel very well located for tourist attractions, especially for shopping on Nathan Road and nearby markets. Eating out is incredibly cheap - meal for two for under Excellent bus network, as well as MTR.
