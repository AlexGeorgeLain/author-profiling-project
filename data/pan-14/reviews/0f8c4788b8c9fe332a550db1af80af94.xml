We wanted to look around in Berlin, however we were here two yers ago, we stayed in the same hotel that time as well. We liked this place so much that we did not search for any other accomodation this time. We found an advantageous two days arrangement on the website which included breakfast, it was not a question whether to stay anywhere else.The rooms are spacoious, clean and has nice warm colours. The location is perfect for touristic and for business trips as well. The hotel is very nice, the staff is very kind, you will find even the finest details perfect here (free internet access, freshly made limonade in the lobby). Don't miss the breakfast, it is awesome. Have a nice stay at this hotel!
