We arrived a few hours early and our room was ready so we got ourselves settled and went out to explore the city.Our room was very clean and the heavenly beds and little extras they put into the Priority Club suites made our night very restful. We were impressed that the Priority Club members had our own breakfast buffet in a lounge on our floors.We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful and would definitely go back.
