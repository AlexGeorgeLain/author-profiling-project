Basically, if you stay here, except to pay for everything, including $6 for a bottle of water. Also, we had to walk far to our room and in the summer heat, it was difficult.Otherwise, the hotel has a wide variety of activities, including a few pools, a great spa, restaurants, etc. We enjoyed our stay, and would most likely stay here again!
