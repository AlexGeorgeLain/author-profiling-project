Our room was very basic even though we had supposedly upgraded to an executive room. It was very noisy at night and it proved impossible to sleep with the air conditioning on as that was very noisy too. Breakfast was at best adequate and the dining area (off reception) very small. If the hotel was full it would be very difficult to seat all guests at the same time. Internet photos were very, very flattering and this hotel does not merit three stars. According to their own stationery Hotel Alamanni is a member of 'Small Elegant Hotels of the World - something we find incomprehensible!
