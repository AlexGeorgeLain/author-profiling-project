We have traveled extensively and have been visiting the Island since 1969. If your tired of the mega roomed hotels that have upscaled the cost and not the experience then this is the place to be. The laid back atmosphere and tropical area around the pool is just what you have been looking for. But most important is the staff. They treat everyone as a person not just a guest. They are the greatest asset of all. Thank you all Marie, Joemar, Brian, And Aarron. With a big HUG and thanks to Judy the manager.
