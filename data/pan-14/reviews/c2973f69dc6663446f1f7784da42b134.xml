If you are sound sensitive, request an interior room as the main street can be very noisy. I loved the location, it was easy for me to walk to all the important sites like the Prado, Reina Sofia, Royal Palace, etc as well as all the major shopping sites (the shoe stores in Madrid are fantastic!). I felt very safe as a female traveler walking during the day to and from my hotel as well as around the rest of Madrid. You are close to restaurants (if you want to wait until the 9 or 10pm for a sit down meal), but there are also a ton of cafes and kebab shops so you can eat when you wish and can come and go as you please. Another tip is that you can head to El Corte Ingles to pick up any groceries if you want to eat Al fresco, or want a simpler meal (they have wonderful take out salads). The front desk staff were wonderful, they spoke Spanish, French, Italian and English, and they booked my early taxi ride to the airport. I would totally recommend the hotel. It may be more expensive than others, but it is worth the cost due to location.
