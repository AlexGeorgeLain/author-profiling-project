Perfect English and very eager to help in anyway. The hotel itself is in a perfect location for any tourist, gay or straight. Most of the gay bars are within 5 blocks of the hotel. I was actually able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. It was a great way to see the city and do all the typical tourist things. I also noticed several heterosexual couples in the hotel who seemed perfectly at home. The hotel is very stylish and comfortable. The roof terrace--pool is not to be missed. Great chill out music, lots of sun, and lots of barely dressed sunbathers. I spent at least an hour up there everyday. Very relaxing to sit and have a cocktail or two on the roof after a day of sight seeing.The breakfast was very good, although possibly a bit overpriced at @12 euros. The room I had--a standard city view--was very comfortable and stylish. I would recommend having a patio view room because at night the streets are very loud with traffic and people running around til 3am, which makes it difficult if you need to have an early night.I noticed during my 3 night stay, the front desk staff, who I thought was exceptional, deal with guest after guest who reluctantly checked out wishing they could stay longer. And the best night I spent in Barcelona was when I took the suggestion of one of the staff as to how I should spend my last night in the city. I haven't had that much fun in a club since my twenties. (im 37 now). My least favorite aspect of staying at the hotel was the abundance of the gay Americans with --- attitudes.
