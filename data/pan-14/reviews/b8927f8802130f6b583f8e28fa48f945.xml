You hardly need to leave W43rd Street for good restaurants and bars - you will of course. The Brooklyn Diner with its fabulous cheescakes and entrees, Tony's for the great meatballs and the Heartland Brewery for locally brewed beer and great steaks are all within fifty yards. Hotel room was compact and had all facilites. With just six floors it was no surprise that there was not a view. The desk was extremely helpful, breakfast was light and good and the early evening wine service helped to meet others.

It is unhurried and professional with an excellent front desk. The 5pm wine interlude gives the chance to meet other guests and to see the world from other people's point of view. Continental breakfast with a good range. A cab ride to most places and good legs required if you wish to walk to local facilites. Try 'Rose's Cafe' or 'Home' on Union Street for light snacks or local restaurant Garibaldi.
