It was my 2nd time there in 5 years, usually going to Novotel NYC. I was upgraded to an executive room at the 41st floor. The room was very large, perfectly clean, with a comfortable king size bed. Nice bathroom with a real tub you can lie in. A lot of towels, changed every day, also bathrobes. Large LCD. A well-sized desk with a good armchair. An high-speed ethernet connection. Everything to work efficiently. I faced an issue with the safe and it was fixed in 10mn. My customer was also satisfied. The only drawbacks are the noises from the 42nd street, even being at the 41st floor (with outside building workers, picking even at 10pm on saturday). The 1st time, my room was on an other side, so less noisy. The breakfast could be better for 30$ (incl.tax tip), lower quality than the one offered at Novotel NYC for the same price. Service is very good (bell men, restaurant, concierge) to excellent (front desk, security and maintenance). Check-in out are very fast. Access is very simple through metro, in between the 42nd and PTA stations, a few steps from PTA terminal to commute to/from airports through the airlink shuttles.I would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a reduced rate, the public fare of 500$ being out of the money.
