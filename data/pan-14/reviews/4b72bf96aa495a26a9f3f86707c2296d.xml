Not only were the staff extremely friendly, but the service, cleanliness and style were amazing. This is an ultra modern hotel, but not so much that you feel you have to wear designer labels just to walk in. The reception girls were so lovely and the consierge was helpful and a great conversationalist! Walking into our room, we were presented with a spotlessly clean bedroom with all the facilities you would expect for this 4 star hotel. The bathroom was massive, with a bath and shower (separate, not together!), a plasma TV, with CNN/BBC, a beautiful view of the garden below and such a comfortable bed! Highly reccomended and perfectly located (just a stroll down to La Rambla), this hotel is a cut above the rest...and for an affordable price too. We're definately staying here again.
