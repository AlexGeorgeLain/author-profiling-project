We loved the unusual design of the room -- a sliding arced wood panel with mirrored square insets that gave access to both the closet and the minibar. A mirrored wall in the entry and what a luxurious bathroom! What a comfortable bed! The only disappointment was no flat-screen TV, but who cared? Not us. We were in easy chairs, sipping green tea, peering out our floor-to-ceiling bay window at Victoria Harbor day and night. Service was impeccable, which means instant. We never really got the hang of logistics at the hotel because it was too easy to just pick up the phone: Ice, please. Not only did ice arrive but shortly afterward someone called to ensure that we'd been iced. Security was so great that if you forgot your room key you couldn't tell the elevator to go to your floor. Nice. The restaurants and food were 5-star, like the hotel. The lobby could have won an interior decoration award. If you get a chance to stay here, don't miss it.
