The hotel, located in a beautifully restored old building in a very central location, looks new and well-kept. The (standard) room, while not very big, had a clean and fresh feel to it. The bathroom was nice with a great shower and good water pressure. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke English very well. On our last day we were able to extend our room stay until 6pm for about 40% of what we paid for a full night. Maybe not cheap, but it allowed us to fully enjoy the day and freshen up before heading back to the airport. We particularly enjoyed the rooftop pool and lounge area. It was very warm when we were in Barcelona and after some sightseeing in the city, it was a great place to relax for a few hours and have some drinks. That brings me to the only negative thing of this hotel. The prices for drinks on the rooftop were excessive; we paid almost 15 euros per drink for a rum cola and a mojito. We also used the indoor pool downstairs, which is beautiful. We will definitely come back here for our next trip to Barcelona.
