We purchased their romance package which included Champagne and chocolates at check-in, breakfast in bed and a late checkout. We could have checked out as late as 2pm. The front desk was great for check-in, quickly answering all questions and the valet service was very quick upon entering and exiting. The room was clean and roomy, king size bed with sofa, chair and coffee table. We enjoyed the little extras in the club room: robes, lighted vanity mirror, in room tea and coffee, and shoe buffer (even a scale in the bathroom, but I avoided it). Our only complaint about the room was the lumpy pillows. The loud bachelorette party coming through the hall at 2:30 didn't even bother me because a year and a half ago I was the bride at one of those loud bachelorette parties staying in a suite at the Handlery.The location of this hotel is great. Very close to shopping, one block from Union Square. We walked most places or caught a cab right out front. Enjoy your stay.
