We are a family of 4 with 2 children (9,7) so a safe well located place with 2 rooms and an easy breakfast is very important. This hotel fits that bill nicely. Absolutely no road noise (except for the rare siren), comfortable beds, and a breakfast that allows even the most picky eaters to find something (e.g. pancakes, eggs, sausage, fruit, cereal, made to order omalettes, waffles, coffee, juices, and on and on) made this an easy choice. Admittedly, we tend to prefer to stay at ES's, so the fact that this one was rated #1 in the city made this a no brainer. I do like the fact that ES tend to be very consistent, and this one was no exception. Parking was about $24 a night for indoor self parking, Internet was about $10 for the day, but I got the impression from reading all the other reviews that these charges were similar to other area lodging. The view from our 8th floor (of 9 in the building) was basically another tall building but this hotel is surrounded by simliarly sized buildings, so if a view is essential to your experience, you may need to inquire at the desk or go elsewhere. U shaped pool with 3 and 4 foot sections were perfect for our sprites. Small gameroom is there, and I saw the exercise area but did not get a chance to look at it. I believe there was a new Starbucks about 2 blocks away along with a CVS pharmacy. Metro is about 4 blocks. All in all, it was a good experience and with only one day to spend, so I took no chances. About $145 with AAA. Hard to beat.
