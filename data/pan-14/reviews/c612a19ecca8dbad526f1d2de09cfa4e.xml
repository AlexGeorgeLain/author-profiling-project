Staff were friendly and very helpful. Rooms are clean, small but functional. When you visit Hong Kong you don't want to stay in the room much which is fortunate for us as our room was at the back and looked directly across into another block of flats and our friends room looked into a block of flats that were being renovated/newly built and was surrounded by green netting. No, we were not given a view over the harbour - do you have to pay extra for that we wondered? There is no lounge to sit in only a few chairs and low tables by the lift or in the bar. However the staff went out of their way to serve us when we hadn't book a table in the restaurant and we only wanted a snack. They moved tables, laid it with white stiff cloths and napkins and served us in the foyer outside the restaurant - the food still tasted good and we were appreciative. Each morning someone knocked on the door to see if we had any laundry we wanted doing. We have stayed at the sister hotel in Kowloon but this is more convenient and we would stay here again.
