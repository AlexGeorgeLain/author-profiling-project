If you want tea Coffee making in your room you will have to upgrade or take your own as we do ! The rooms are quite contemporary and have lovely marble bathrooms .The Hotel service was first class and the buffet breakfast wonderful with lots to choose from. The tourist bus stop is just round the corner for both the blue red route, can 100% recommend the tourist bus.The only negative was that they are working on the Metro so you could not get a taxi to the Hotel door.
