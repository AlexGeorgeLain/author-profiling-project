I enjoyed my one night stay and will return. The staff is truly eager to please and very friendly. The breakfast is amazing andactually worth $16.99. Wish I had time to enjoy the beautiful rooftoppool. This centurion dowager is rich with history and beautiful architectural details. To be a true five star hotel, a little freshening up is needed. Every surface in the corridors and rooms should be repainted and probably complete carpet replacement is needed too. Don't let the little imperfections pervent you from enjoying a truly unique New Orleans experience.
