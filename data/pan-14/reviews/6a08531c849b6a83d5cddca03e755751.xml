The room was extremely basic and on our arrival we got placed in a room with three single beds as opposed to a double that we had booked as they said they had all been booked up! (we booked six months in advance!)However the room was very clean and had everything we needed except we couldnt work out if the air conditioning had broken or it was just old as it was useless! But we managed fine without it!Another problem was that EVERY day at around 3/4pm we heard the sound of fireworks outside which we found annoying especially if we had gone back for a siesta! But we were hardly ever there so it didnt affect us too much and anyway eventually you got used to it!The hotel staff were helpful and spoke very good English! And the breakfasts were actually quite nice (very basic but included toast, beans, small sausages, ham and cheese, tea and fruit juice) We found it was hard to get a table between 9.30-10am so we would wait until gone ten as it was more quiet and also there was more fresh food as they would keep bringing it out along with clean plates and cutlery!Overall we would recommend due to the price and location (although quite a way from the beach - about 40min walk)PS - recomend the metro, very easy to use and cheap!
