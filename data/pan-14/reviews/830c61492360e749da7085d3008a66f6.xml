It is a convenient location to get around the city (just across the street from a train stop) and the hotel itself is quite comfortable. On our last trip we brought along our 3-year old and they went all out to make his stay fun. The front desk always knew his name, calling him Mr. Alex, which he got quite a kick out of. The concierge helped to secure a babysitter for a couple of evenings, which was a nice way to detour from children's activities to a broadway show.The complimentary buffet breakfasts in the lobby are done quite elegantly, with various cereals, breads, cheeses, fruits, etc. Plus an espresso machine makes a variety of caffeine-loaded drinks that is much needed for navigating your way around the city (there is also a nice selection of teas). In the evening they serve wine and cheese, the ideal way to wind down after a busy day. The rooms are fairly big by NYC standards. We booked a junior suite which had a good size living room and a bedroom. Good closet space (so many rooms in NYC don't have that so when I come across a hotel that does I am thrilled) and a very pleasant and helpful staff. We had to extend our stay 2 days because our son became ill and they accommodated us with no problems. Also, if you are traveling with kids, there is a great playground 1 block away where the kids can mess around and tire themselves out!A highly recommended hotel for everyone.
