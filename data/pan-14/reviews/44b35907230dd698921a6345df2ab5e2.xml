Although there were technical difficulties with our stay (and we only ended up staying one night instead of two), the staff went out of their way to do everything possible to resolve the problem. Just before we arrived, the air conditioning failed in 3 of their rooms -- of course our room housed the a/c machinery. They were able to rebook us into another room for the first night but they were totally booked the second. Not only did they give us a huge discount on the huge room that they moved us to but they couldn't have been nicer. It all worked out in the end.....we decided to get out of hot and humid Florence and head to Lucca a day early. This hotel is VERY clean. The hike up the stairs to the elevator reminded me again that I should've packed lighter :)
