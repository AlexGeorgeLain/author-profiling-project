It was nice but not very special. The staff in the restaurants and at the hotel were not friendly nor particularly helpful.When we booked our next trip, we stayed at the PK and were very pleased with everything. On our second visit, our room was upgraded and we were treated to a surprise bottle of sparkling wine.The entire staff is helpful and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome.
