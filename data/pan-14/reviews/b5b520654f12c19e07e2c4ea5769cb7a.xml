This hotel is HUGE, one of the largest I have seen. The grounds are beautiful and the hotel is very well kept. The staff were friendly. It is convenient to most of the city. Although the room was a good bargain, the hotel does charge for just about everything that it can consider an extra, including parking. Although I am used to paying for parking in many metropolitan areas, I lived in Dallas for several years and there is plentiful parking everywhere for free so I was surprised by this. The room was a nice size. I would stay there again.

The room was plenty big, especially by NYC standards, for three people. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is great for anyone looking to shop along Madison Ave or 5th Ave. Cabs are aplenty and the subway is also nearby. We walked into Times Square and to Central Park. My only complaint is that the hotel is a little on the noisy side. We could hear the people in the room next to us and people in the hall. A little soundproofing would go a long way.
