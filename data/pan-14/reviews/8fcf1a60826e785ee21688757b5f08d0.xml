It's centrally located in Waikiki, it's off the main drag, it's clean, has good parking and has easy access to the beach and shopping.Our package included breakfast, parking and a rental car. The restaurant food was very good and the was service friendly and accommodating.The room was clean with a nice view of the beach. The pool (on the 7th floor) is small and water was cold. A parking garage is connected to the hotel and is very convenient. At check-in they recommended valet parking for which we were not charged any extra. The self park entrance is at the front of the hotel on the next street over from Lewers. Use the self parking after you retrieve your car.The major minor to this hotel is the 4 AM - 6 AM noise of the delivery trucks backing up into the Sheraton off Lewers. It's a loud beep-beep-beep that echoes off the buildings. If anybody says it's not noisy, then they are deaf. Until the PARC does something to fix this issue (they are aware of it), plan go to bed at 9 PM or stick some cotton in your ears or stay somewhere else.
