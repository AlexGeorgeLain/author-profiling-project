I must admit that I called the Starwood number and stated my concerns as I had read on Trip Advisor. He reassured me that it would be okay and would email the hotel with my concerns. So after a 5 day stop in Maui, we arrived at this lovely hotel....charm that most newer structures lack! Our room was in good condition tho a little worn about the edges which we expected. The service was exceptional from champagne and banana bread delivered to our room on arrival to an invite for a cocktail party on our last evening. I am so happy that we did stay here and am sure that the newly redone rooms will be deluxe!! I hope to return for another stay within the next few years.
