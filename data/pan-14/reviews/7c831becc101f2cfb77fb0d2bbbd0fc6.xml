It was mostly a very pleasant experience - the staff are particularly friendly and helpful and the rooms clean and well-equipped. They are small, but Boston hotel rooms often are and I found this one more manageable than the poky little closet that I got at the Omni Parker House last time I was in the city. The complimentary continental breakfast was good value, particularly when faced with a challenging day of eating for the company. The rooms are remarkably quiet considering the location on Boylston, which is quite a party street. The air conditioning is also discreet and effective so I got some really good sleep, which was much needed to work from 08:30 until 22:00. However, all the awards are for the opening in 2006 and some investment is becoming due. Frankly, the towels were threadbare and I would not have been surprised to put my feet through the sheets. I also had some intricate cross-cultural negotiations to get a plug for the bathroom hand-basin (or a stopper for the bathroom sink, if you are reading this in US English).
