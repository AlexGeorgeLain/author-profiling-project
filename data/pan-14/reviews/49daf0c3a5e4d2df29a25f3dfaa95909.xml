Given the price level of hotels in NYC, we were fully satisfied with the price/value proposition of this property.The hotel had standard Courtyard functionality, nothing fancy. Our 2 weekend nights were almost $100 less per night than the 2 weekday nights. Having stayed at a number of Courtyards before, we particularly appreciate the breakfast buffet, the laundry machines, and the free access to computers to check e-mail, etc.While a few blocks away from Rockefeller Center and Times Square, there is a subway station located at the corner, which we made extensive use of.There is a big Duane Reade drugstore in the same building and a variety of useful restaurants (Chipotle and similar) and shops (Barnes and Noble,etc.) are located in the office buidings within a block.Unless you need a 4-star hotel or need to stay in the middle of the action, this hotel is a fine option.
