The rooms are nice and comfortable. The pool is amazing and right in front of the beach. The staff is very friendly and amazing. They are very energetic with the activities they do throughout the day and at night. They are very friendly with the guests. Yudy was an entertainer and she was very nice and attentive as was the rest of the entertainers at the hotel. The only thing is the ride from the airport but don't let that discourage you because once you arrive you get that taste of paradise.
