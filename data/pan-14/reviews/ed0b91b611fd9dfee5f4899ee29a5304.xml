We booked a 2-bedroom deluxe apartment and was upgraded to an Executive Two Bedroom / 2 Bathroom on the top floor. The view from the beautifully furnished apartment and the 2 balconies was spectacular. The kitchen had a full compliment of utensils, etc. When a bottle of wine packed in my luggage broke in transit, I really appreciated the washer and dryer in the unit. There is a small supermarket within a block as well as several restaurants nearby. Although The York is within walking distance to many attractions, there is a train station around the corner that goes to most other places in the CBD (central business district). We bought a day pass that included the train, buses, and ferries. We took the ferry to Manly late afternoon, had dinner in Manly, and returned to Sydney at night with a fantastic night view of the city and opera house.
