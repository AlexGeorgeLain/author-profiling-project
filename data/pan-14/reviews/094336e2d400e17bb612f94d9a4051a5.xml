So many people were in town. Definately a great time to Be in LA. Will definately go back. Rooms are very clean, and house keeping is very attentive. Food is a bit pricey, but decent. Shopping is nearby. Concierge was very helpful in providing me with a map to Rodeo Drive. Had a great time. Will definately go back and bring my husband with me this time!
