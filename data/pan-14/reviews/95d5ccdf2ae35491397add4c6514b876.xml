It had a computer that was free for use for its guests. The hotel staff was not overly welcoming but was available for answering questions at any time. The room we stayed in was on the same level as the front desk and the computer. It was a rather large room with very high ceilings. We were able to open our windows which faced a corridor. For light sleepers it might be slightly noisy but we had no problem in general. It was a good value.

There was a long line just to check in ...thank goodness for the Hilton Honors line. It's like a little town in and of itself. It's very hectic yet fun...we came from four nights in Kauai and were a little shocked at the congestion and the crowds. But we are city people and loved being back in the swing of things. You literally don't have to leave this village at all...there is shopping, eating and pools pools and more pools. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower. Great views...2 balconies in our room. The room as just ok --- no frills, basic room with a small bathroom. Carpet was a little dirty but the bed was the standard Hilton bed. Food was outrageously expensive ($14 burger) at the grill by the pool, and the bfast buffet was nothing to write home about. The noodle shop in the village was tasty and cheap. We ventured to many sushi stops outside of the village. It was a nice stay. I would stay again because I like the hustle and bustle of the hotel. If you don't like crowds, noise and people, then stay away.
