The staff was wonderful - they even made hot chocolate for us on a cold winter night - no charge. The location could not be better.... just far enough from Times Square but close enough to all tourist attractions, shopping, restaurants, and theatres. BUT the true find was the HUGE LUXURIOUS room - complete with feather beds, a marble bathroom, pool-sized bathtub, flannel robes. Plus... the Cafe Olympus 30 seconds down the block serves the BEST (yet inexpensive) breakfast.A HIT!!!!!!

Upon arrival the staff was really rude - they mixed up our room reservation - and threatened to throw the three of us (mom and sister and I) out onto the street. The manager finally gave us a room with 2 twin beds. Sleeping in the crack of 2 twin beds pushed together was not fun, especially after long days in NYC.The room was very TINY. The bathroom was microscopic. 2 people could not stand in it at the same time.The room was very loud and we could hear everyone coming and going in the hallway all night long (2 am - 8 am).Would not stay here again.... ever
