It was not our choice - but included in our Package - Having read the reviews on this site, when we checked in - which wasn't a problem even tho there were quite a few of us coming of a flight - we requsted a Golf view side, which wasn't a problem, was also asked if smoking or non. Glad we got the golf view side, as others who had the other side had said looking out to a building site is not a good start for a holiday. for us even tho we were there just over night and the following morning, there was no were to go. It is very good for an overnight stop to catch a flight or similar, but not if you want to be near shops, restuarants etc.We had a bite in the bar that evening (that is all we wanted) and found the staff friendly. The room suited our needs - and after coming off a long haul flight, found the bed comfy (we had a king size). Breakfast was continental or hot, we had the conti which was very sufficient. The following morning sat by the pool which was pleasant. The reason I have given it a Neutral rating was the position for us!
