I heard about the Royal Plaza through TripAdvisor and picked it as my hotel of choice when booking my vacation through Zuji. Arriving at the hotel, just walking across the wonderfully-designed lobby made me feel like royalty. Check-in was very efficient and I was in my room with my bags in under 10 minutes. The property is ideally located on Scotts Roads, running perpendicular to Orchard Road, the shopping mecca of Singapore. There are many outlets and restaurants in the area, so you won't ever run out of places to shop or eat. Carousel, the restaurant in the lobby, arguably has one of the best halal buffets ever (the Sultan of Brunei owns this hotel and the Hyatt across the road). As for rooms, I was booked into a Superior. The room was minimally appointed, but the bathroom was nice and the bed was comfortable. There was a strange stench in the mini-bar, which was due to spilled milk and coffee that had not been cleaned before my arrival. The desk chair was also very uncomfortable due to an uneven seat. When I entered the room, the toilet seat was loose, so I had maintenance fix that immediately.All in all, it is a comfortable hotel, but I'm just a little picky about the quality of the rooms I stay in. Highly recommended =)
