I read the reviews on this site after I booked and was quite concerned. The room is small, but clean and everything works. Hot water. Toilet has powerful flush. Fine for me. They are located excellently on La Rambla, yet the room is quiet. Easy to find after dark from the Metro (Catalunya). Best of all they have free internet and are trialling Wi-Fi (doesn't work in my room but good at reception). Excellent value hotel in my opinion.
