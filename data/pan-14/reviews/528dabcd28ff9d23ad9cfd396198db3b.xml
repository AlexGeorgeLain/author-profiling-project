However, do NOT stay if you intend to stay a few days.1.) No free continental breakfast, you pay for a real breakfast2.) Parking is $12 per day one block away! Parking at the hotel is $24 per day!3.) No free internet access, that is $10.95However, look of the hotel and comfort is great. Hotel food is great but expensive. My recommendation, stay 1 night flying thru LA is okay....coming with a car whatsoever, do not stay here.
