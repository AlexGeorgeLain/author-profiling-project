We stayed here for 3 nights and were very pleased with the size of our rooms, nice clean comfortable beds and pillows. The beds are typical of those in Europe - 2 single beds pushed together. This not only gives a nice large bed, it also means you don't have to fight for the duvet as you get one each. We'd booked the deluxe rooms and they were a reasonable size, at the back of the building and were very quiet. The bathroom was a good size too. The rooms were clean, but the housekeeping after that was not very good. We had to ask every day for extra tea/coffee etc as the amounts left in the room were very frugal, especially as the weather was so cold (we had snow) and wanted to warm up with hot drinks. We were only given one robe and no slippers. We requested them at reception twice, but they never appeared - very frustrating when you've paid for a deluxe room! On the Sunday we had a picnic breakfast in the room with our friends (not too many places open for breakfast on a Sunday in November, breakfast at the hotel is extremely expensive) so there were quite a few crumbs on the floor. They were still there after the room had been serviced (even this was not done till 5.00pm).The concierge was very helpful and attentive.The hotel is well placed for exploring both the canals and the architecture. We had lots of long walks, even in the snow. There are plenty of very good places to eat, or sit and have a drink and watch the world go by.We'd still stay at the hotel again, as everything apart from housekeeping was good.
