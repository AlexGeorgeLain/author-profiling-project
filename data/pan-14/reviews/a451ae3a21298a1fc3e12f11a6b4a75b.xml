We had an ocean front room (10th floor) nicely decorated very clean. Beds/pillows/towels/bath products good quality. LaVista restaurant on site great food/good service. Friday night seafood buffet worth the $30. Pool/beach area beautiful. Pool towels and chairs plentiful and in good shape. Location of this hotel near many resturants and bus stop. Walgreens just up the street is open 24hours. Safe and refrigerator in room very handy. Casino comps could be better, lost money but had a great time. Consider trying the Radisson up the street, small but fun (they serve sandwiches and soup at the machines)! We were at the Marriott 10 nights and can't say enough about how nice this place is. I think the only downfall is the $14.00/day parking fee if you rent a car. Consider only renting on the days you need to use a car. Hertz is just a few doors is cheaper than the Hertz counter at the hotel. Taxi service available 24 hours.Go to this hotel so you can enjoy the beach and hear the waiter say, Pina Coladas, Strawberry Daquiris, Margaritas, bottled water........
