It is a very short walk to the beach and all shopping locations. A good remodeling is long overdue, or maybe just a really good cleaning. I definitely agree, in it's day, this must have been a really beautiful hotel.

My pillow case still had black mascara from the previous guest. When I looked behind the curtains, I discovered mold growing on them!! The window lock was broken. Although it is close to Union Square, it is a rough part of town. Walking these streets at night is not safe. The free pastries as disgusting! I would not eat them if they paid me to!
