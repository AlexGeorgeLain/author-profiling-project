The location worked out wonderful and we were able to walk to 5th avenue, central park and many other touristy destinations. The staff was very helpful, they gave us the exact trains we needed to take to get to the Yankee's game. The hotel bar was charming, a bit pricey but something I would picture in NYC. Our room was spacious for NY standards and the room was very clean. I would definately stay here again!

She wanted more of relaxation and I wanted golfing and hiking. We got to do a little of both, the golf course was fantastic and our guide on our hike was full of all kinds of information. I didn't visit the spa, but my sister gave it rave reviews. It had a small, but adequate gym, I got to get some cardio in each day. The set up of the suites and rooms was very cute, it reminded me of a little village. The room itself was really nice, there was a seperate sitting area/tv area that was nice with two queen comfy beds in another room. The pools were abundant, they included everything from quiet/adult to busy/kid friendly. Lastly, the Point of View resturant is well worth the money, the view was beautiful and the meal was very tasty! I wish I could go back right now!
