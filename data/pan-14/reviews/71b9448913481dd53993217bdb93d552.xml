My wife and I spent six nights there in the past three weeks: four before a cruise and two after it. My wife lost her plug adaptor, and the staff came up with a box behind the desk and loaned us one. The airline lost our luggage for a day, and the staff brought it up the moment it arrived. We arrived before rooms were ready when our cruise ended, and the staff placed our bags in a locked room until the room was ready, then moved everything themselves. They explained how to get to a theater that has movies in English. It's clean, it's in a great location; it's quiet. The only thing it isn't is expensive. At 85 euros per night (about $115), it's half what most hotels in Barcelona seem to go for.
