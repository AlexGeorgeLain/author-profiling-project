Both times we were greeted by the friendly welcoming staff who made us feel very much 'at home'. Even to the point that on our return to the hotel three weeks after the first visit one of the staff at the door said welcome back!!The hotel is in a pleasant and very quiet location and we appreciated the courtesy bus to and fro the airport plus the courtesy bus to Orchard Road for shopping. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. All in all a very happy stay and we shall certainly return.
