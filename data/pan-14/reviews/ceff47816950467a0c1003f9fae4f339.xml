It is about a 15 minute walk from the main attractions, but you do get more of a feel to the city than just being on the doorstep of the everything. The only disadvantage to this is that we didn't venture very far afield in the evening as we were so tired after a busy day out. Very comfortable rooms, the air-conditioning is a little noisy but if you leave the balcony door slightly ajar at night this does away with the noise. Good shower and bathroom facilities.There are a few good eateries pretty close by. Alfredos is very good, some of the most delicious food I have eaten in a long time, the goose carpaccio and bruschetta is great. There is Persuas nearby where the speciality is steak and also carpaccio. We have a lovely meal at The Accadamia in Piazza San Marco, not too far away. The taxi fare from Statzione Santa Maria Novella is approx 8 euros , the train from Pisa is 7 euro.There is also the Terravision bus from Pisa Airport/Florence station which is 8 euros and runs every hour.
