It is well located, a comfortable size and the rooms are spacious and clean. What's more, this was cheaper than the Radisson. The staff were friendly and helpful and this even had breakfast included. Breakfast is OK but we chose to eat out a couple of times to get the New York experience.The hotel doesn't look great from the outside but don't be put off, it is fine inside and perfectly OK if you are looking to stay in Central NY and want a bit of space.
