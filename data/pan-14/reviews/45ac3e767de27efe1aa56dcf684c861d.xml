I booked the room on Priceline and was surprised to get it for $60 per night. I was not expecting the top quality that we got with this room, due to the low, low price. Remember that January in Hawaii is HIGH season and you would expect to pay much more for a top notch room. The room was very large, in the Yacht Harbor Tower and was extremely comfortable and quiet. The only disappointment was the fact that we could not get a queen or king room - ended up with a room with 2 doubles, but it was non-smoking. Could have gotten a king smoking room, but prefer non-smoking. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We needed to do a very late checkout because we had a 9:30PM flight back to the mainland. The charge for a 6PM checkout was an additional $50.00, but we thought it was well worth the cost. We had a convertible and did not want to drive all over Honolulu on our last day with a car full of luggage. This rate was called the Linger Longer rate and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a very late checkout. We truly enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone!!!!
