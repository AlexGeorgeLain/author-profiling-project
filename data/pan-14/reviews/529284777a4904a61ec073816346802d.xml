We had a very good deal from a travel website and paid 112 per night including breakfast and an upgrade to de-luxe rooms. We all thought that was about the right price and would not have been happy to have paid much more. The staff were very pleasant, the bed was superb, the views were great, breakfast was full of good choices. The downside was the location. 20/25 minutes away from Barcelona centre and a hopeless shuttle bus that ran from 10am to 6 pm and only took a small number of people. Cabs cost around 40 euros return to the centre. My advice is, if you want to see Barcelona book a city centre hotel. Also, in the summer a large theme park/fairground attraction is right next door and that could be noisy.

The location is excellent, you can walk almost everywhere and the metro is 2 minutes walk. Very comfortable room but very dark as we asked for a quiet room and this meant inside with no view. The lighting was only just sufficient. A room with a view and more light would mean being on Gran Via, very noisy. Friendly staff, comfortable bed, clean room, we would certainly return. We didn't try the restaurant. We went to the bar but it was very badly run, had to make a fuss to get served. One poor waiter looking after the whole room while half a dozen staff behind the bar running around like headless chickens. A stylish bar nevertheless but needs a proper manager.
