Since the price difference was only 8 euro, my husband asked the differences between the two. We were told the Steigenberger was a 5 star, closer to the airport and had a nice spa/pool area so that is what we chose. Similar to other reviews, we found the hotel staff to be extremely rude. The room was okay; the pool area average. The hotel is typical of any other airport hotel find in the States. Nothing about this hotel warrants a 5-star rating. We also ate at the adjacent hotel buffet which was horrible and my husband let them know it. It still makes me sick to see the $89 charge on my credit card bill. It was a shame that was our last meal in Germany before returning to the home.The only positive thing about this hotel is the location and shuttle to the airport.
