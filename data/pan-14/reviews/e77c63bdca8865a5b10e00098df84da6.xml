Niggles first - if you are at the front of the hotel, there is early morning noise from the deliveries to the (wonderful) Fairway market, so bring your earplugs. The room safe was broken, and I spotted some crumbs on the floor at the side of the cooker. However, using the hotel safe was easy and free, and the suite was otherwise very clean, if in need of redecoration. I would be more than happy to stay here again.The hotel is in a great situation, very handy for the subway, and for Central Park. We mostly ate breakfast in the room, but were pleased with breakfast at the diner downstairs, where we also had a decent evning meal.If you get chance in amongst the more obvious sightseeing, the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side is a gem for a bit of social history.
