I travel 200M miles a year..stay in tons of hotels. This not a repeat. Room tired....bad bathroom caulking, tired bed, pillows, bedcover, carpet tatty...pass on it if you can.

Super location 4 mins walk from Shibuya station - although super hard to find if taking train from Narita (45 mins) then to town, switching to another train to then walk to hotel.....you MUST take the bus right ot the hotel! Easy peasy.Overall hotel - killer. The bar at top is fantastic with awesome views.Stay here - a little more expensive but well worth it.

Staff could be friendly but not consistantly..... food good in restaurant but breakfast was skimpy and awful- as if they were holding back so they could save on costs. At Christmas we were paying over $300 a night for two rooms. Street was VERY LOUD - YOU MUST ASK TO SAY AWAY FROM THE STREET (over the entrance). A car alarm went off all night and they refused to call the police to do somethign about it. They refused to accept that the car was owned by a guest. It turns out the car was owned by a guest, who the next day heard about the problem was very non-chalant. The rooms were tired but clean - but not that comfortable. Beach was right there but wasn't that nice. It is a long drive to Old Town. This is how disappointed I was...I was there 11 months ago...I'm writing today.
