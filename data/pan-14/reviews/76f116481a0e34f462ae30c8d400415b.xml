The front desk was very cordial and helpful. We arrived shortly after noon due to an early flight arrival. They were able to give us several room choices and we relaxed on the grounds. Enjoyed the cocktails in the evening and breakfast on the deck. The room, facing the courtyard, was large and comfortable. We were far from the front area, but like that so we could take a walk. Beautiful, well maintained grounds. We sat around the pool and although did not swim, we enjoyed all of what was going on. This hotel is easy to find and close to the freeway. We have not stayed at an Embassy Suite before, but after this nice experience would check it out.
