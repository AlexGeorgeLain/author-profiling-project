We stayed at the Caribe Hilton for 5 nights and loved every minute!We went with our friends, with whom we travel every summer, and stayed in Room 902 (they were in 901). These are Jr. Suites on the Executive Lounge level. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable with great ocean views. The Executive lounge was good for breakfast, afternoon and evening snacks. The staff was great: Omar, the Exec. Lounge concierge was helpful and even booked us at Restaurant Barrachina and arranged a front row table for the wonderful flamenco show; Isabela, who took care of our room; Angel, the Asst. Mngr. who kept the magnificent grounds neat and clean and Hiram, the bartender at the swim-up bar.The only negative: we have preferred evening entertainment in the Oasis Bar.Would we book there again? IN A HEARTBEAT!!!!
