Not a great location.Beach is only for looking at, high surf and lots of rocks = I saw no one in the water.One elevator broken so wait times became long.Wireless Internet access was poor. It couldn't hold my vpn for more than a few minutes.Two days without hot water.My advice is to either pay the money to be close to Old San Juan or go closer to the airport near a real beach.
