The rooms are clean but very small, if you want a closed in kind of feeling then this is the place for you. Not me, I would not choose to stay at the Milner again. The expression you could not swing a cat should come to your mind. The interior of the hotel could do with a bit of a tidy up. Location wise it's ok. Easy for walking in the city and public transport.

Easy to get to the local tourist sites. I can recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a central location to stay. Easy to get to and from the airport from the State T station. Internet access is available in the lounge for free.
