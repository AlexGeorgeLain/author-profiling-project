Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were a great size, clean with good storage and a tv but no tea or coffee facilities in the room. Bathrooms was good with an excellent shower, hairdryer was ok but would recommend taking your own. Hotel was a 10 minute walk from the nearest tube, but it was a pleasant walk in the sun, and a great way of seeing all the little bars/cafes in the streets.Bus stop was outside the hotel, but only used this for the bus to the airport, which was a good quick and cheap way to get to and from the airport. Bus collects from just outside the terminals and runs all day long!great places to eat in the nearby area close to the hotel, did eat in the city centre once in the evening, was ok but very busy at times, so many places to choose from you can have too much choice!Great places to eat down on both ports, tourist bus is great way to go around the city, recommend buying the 2 day ticket! Will definatley be going back again in the future, Barcelona has so much to offer!
