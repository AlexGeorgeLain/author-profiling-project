Near the White House and Metro stop. Nice, friendly concierge staff. Very helpful in finding excellent food.Rooms very quiet.On the bad side:Restaurant very expensive with average food. At least there was a Starbucks at the next corner.Very small. Other than the bar and the room, there is no where to sit and relax.Biggest complaint is the bed was very uncomfortable. Mattress was old and very saggy.We provided a helpful complaint upon check out by never heard anything.
