The room (4406) was large and I loved the bathroom. Although I did find a hat in the room when I checked in that did not belong there. The bed was very comfortable and the tub was nice and big. I liked that the toilet was seperate from the tub and sink. The room was comfortable and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The pool and casino are open 24 hours which is nice. The casino is large (for a hotel) but seemed to be filled with mostly nickel machines. I had a good one night's stay there. Others in the group stayed longer and loved every minute of it. I would stay there again.
