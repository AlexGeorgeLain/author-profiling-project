The kids club was quite nice also.We had a one-bedroom apartment which was very nice for our family. More space than a regular hotel room. The room and the grounds were very clean.The breakfast buffet was very nice also.The staff is quite friendly.The evening buffet was a bit expensive, so we went to the Novotel Tanjung Benoa for their evening buffet (it's a bit less expensive). We enjoy the Novotel food all over Indonesia.This location has a bit different feel than the other Novotel resorts in Indonesia, since it has apartments. It's a bit less ethnic / exotic in its feeling and atmosphere.
