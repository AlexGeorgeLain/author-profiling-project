The room we stayed in was very spacious, with two large queen beds, a big TV, a nice dresser with a big mirror, a table with two chairs and a big wardrobe. The bathroom was good enough:pretty small with a bathtub but very very clean and with loads of fresh towels everyday. In the room we also found a long list of restaurants from where we could order in. The staff at the Midtown was friendly enough and very helpful. One of our suitcases got lost at the airport and the guy at the reception desk offered many times to call British Airways to help us locate it, and when it finally arrived at the hotel they brought it directly to our room. The location of the Midtown is very good, it's just in front of the Scientist Church (which I think is beautiful!) and a few steps from Prudential Center, where there are many shops and restaurants (Top of the Hub...very posh!). There are two T stops (subway) really only a couple of minutes away (even though I have to say that the trains are not many and that we pretty always waited a few good minutes to get on one!). The Museum of Fine Arts is within walking distance (10 minutes tops!) and so is Copley Square. Although the actual city centre (around Fenueil Hall) is quite distant if you're walking from the Midtown, it's only about 3 or 4 T stops away, and even if you have to wait a little for the train to arrive it never takes more than 20 minutes!I will defintely stay there again next time I'll visit Boston!
