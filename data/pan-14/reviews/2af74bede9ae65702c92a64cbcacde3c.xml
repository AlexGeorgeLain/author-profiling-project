We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. They recommended shops, tours, places to eat and attractions. They booked our Moulin Rouge trip and ensured that our car turned up to take us back to the airport on the last day. The elevator was a bit compact and the Hallways/Stairwells were a bit narrow. Our room faced onto the internal atrium. At frst I was disappointed that we did not have a view, but in retrospect, I am glad that we had peace and quiet away from the street. Our room had comtemporary decor and attactive furnishings, but again, it was quite small. The En Suite was fully tiled with a power shower. The room was clean and in good condition. Continental breakfast was included and was as expected. We found the location very good. St. Germain area is lovely with it's own outdoor market, an abundance of shops and places to eat. Very close to Maubert Mutualite metro station. Would stay here again if I am ever back in this lovely city.
