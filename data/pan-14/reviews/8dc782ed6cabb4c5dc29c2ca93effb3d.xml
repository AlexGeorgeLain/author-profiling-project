The hotel was accomodating to our needs and charged a fair price despite our bind. The room was spotless and comfortable. The desk staff were lovely. Breakfast was abundant though not particularly innovative. The hotel is half a block from the nearest subway and convenient to all public transportation as well as being within walking distance of many tourist attractions.i will stay here again.
