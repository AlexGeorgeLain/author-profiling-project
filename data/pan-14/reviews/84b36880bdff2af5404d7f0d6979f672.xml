I have been in both and I can say that this one should be the 4 star one. The rooms are big, clean, with lots of decoration and most of them have a balcony.The staff is very friendly and helpfull. The restaurant is quite good too.The location is unbeatable, right in front of the Cathedral.

Unlike to what happens to Regencia de booked a room in Regencia de Colon because we had been there before and we loved it. Besides that, this hotel was extremely expensive.When we got to the Regencia de Colon, they told us that we were going to be upgraded to the Colon one so we were very happy. However, our happyness only lasted a couple of minutes till we saw our room. It was tiny for a 4 star hotel (half of the side the one) dated, bare and it stank of smoke. Besides that we got a room that overlooked the cathedral which was on works so the noise was totally unbearable, specially in the mornings. The toilet was also old and quite dirty.We were very disappointed with the hotel and wanted to go back to the Regencia one but they told us that is was overbooked! So it was our last time in this chain.
