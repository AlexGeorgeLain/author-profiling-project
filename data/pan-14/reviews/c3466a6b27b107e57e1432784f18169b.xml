When I arrived they gave me a room and it was completely dirty, there were a lot of hairs in all the bathroom and in the sheet too. I went to the front door and I asked them to change me for the other room immediately. They changed me but the problems were the same. When you arrive you must pay U$6 for Internet, telephone and breakfast, but the telephone did not work, the signal from the internet was horrible and the breakfast was a joke. The next day I found another hotel to stay. It was impossible to stay.
