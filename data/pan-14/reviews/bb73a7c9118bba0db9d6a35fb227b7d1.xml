Nicely designed with ample bathrooms. There is a kitchenette with a small fridge, allowing you to stock some groceries and wine. In the morning the staff drops off fresh bread (the fridge was pre-stocked). There is a nespresso machine as well. All in all very good, the small staircase might be an issue when carrying a lot of luggage.
