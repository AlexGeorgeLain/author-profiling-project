Because its innumerable skyscrapers generate a colossal amount of refuse--all of which must be compacted . . . slowly . . . late at night . . . by jarringly-noisy garbage trucks. Please read on, because I do love this hotel, but if you stay there, ask for a room that doesn't face the street. Though I was located on the 11th floor behind double-paned windows during this visit, the bewitching-hour garbage runs were a bit disturbing. Now, the good news. This was the second time that I have stayed at the Elysee while leading a tour group. I've never had anything but praise from the more than 40 travelers I have taken there, and I wouldn't hesitate to use the hotel again. (I doubt that even the nearby Waldorf-Astoria or St. Regis have been engineered well enough to drown out those cursed trucks.) The location is superb. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. On both stays, I have had a spacious, immaculate, and very nicely appointed room. As others have noted, the second floor lounge/library space is one of the hotel's most pleasing assets. It is the perfect spot to relax and feel at home for a mid-afternoon break with coffee and a newspaper or for a pre-theatre glass of wine and hors d'oevres. (Bonus: the nearby 21 Club offers a prix-fixe, pre-theatre dinner that is both a memorable experience and a good value.)
