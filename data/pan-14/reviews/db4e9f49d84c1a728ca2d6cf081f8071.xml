A great location (near Circular Quay) and good public areas were let down by small rooms (with tiny twin beds) and indifferent service. Room facilities were also pretty basic for Four Seasons. The staff were friendly but there were too few of them, although the concierge was good. There must be better alternatives in this wonderful city.

Apart from a very comfortable bed, the room was average. Bathroom well below 5 star standard and bring your own toiletries as the hotel offering was mediocre.Breakfast was good, very fresh cooked options, great coffee.Staff were average. Concierge not much help sorry we can't book Alcatraz for you......... no further offer of help.Next time I go, I will try somewhere else.
