Taking advice from others we breakfasted at the Hollywood cafe, it was a lot smaller than I anticipated but the service was excellent and the breakfast was the benchmark for all others on our trip, it was never bettered. On eof our party suffering with jet-lag turned up at 6-45 am and was told We don't open until 7-00 but come in and have a coffee while you wait!! The imtationtram tour bus just round the corner is recommended , knowledgable and entertaining guide anda good value trip.
