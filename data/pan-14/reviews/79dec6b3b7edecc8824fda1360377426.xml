For a large Hotel I was always called by name and the Ass. Manager even ordered one of the house cars to take me to dinner.All the reviews are right. This is one of the best Hotels I have ever stayed in.And by the way, this must be the place to stay as while I was there M. Jordan checked in.

I asked to be moved and was told they would move me in the morning but they never got around to it. I called both the reception and the concierge and got no answer at either. The service was bad and reception seemed to not care. It was just not me that was dissapointed. There were several post cruise people staying at the Hotel and everyone except one did not like their room. This is not a 5 star hotel as stated. It is a two star at best. The location was good, but I will never stay there again.
