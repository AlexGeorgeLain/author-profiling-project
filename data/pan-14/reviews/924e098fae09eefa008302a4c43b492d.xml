Tired? Not in the slightest. The hotel is decorated in a very modern and chic fashion. The rooms aren't large - but if you want bigger, upgrade to a bigger room. They are MORE than sufficient. The beds are so comfy and the bedding 1st class. The bathrooms are luxurious and the complimentary Aveda products were a dream....Furthermore, the reception staff were very polite and so helpful. For my partners birthday they arranged for a cake to be delivered to our room - with their compliments - and as a surprise. Aloof? Not that we came across. They are effiicient and curteous.All in all the stay was first class. The bar and the restuarant is verging on the pricey side but the atmosphere is good. It is where the beautiful people go and if you like people watching stay here to join them.....If you need a central location, where the sights and bars of Madrid are in walking distance, then this is the hotel for you....
