So, to preface everything, when you get something for free, you can't really complain TOO much about it. If I had paid $400/night for the room we stayed in, it would have been completely unacceptable. The room was in the middle of the three wings of the now-combined resort, and it was TINY. It did have a somewhat-ocean view out of a small side window, but otherwise the room was dominated by the king-size bed. Beyond that, there was barely room to walk around. Compared to other Hawaii properties (i.e., the Hilton Hawaiian Village) which cost less, this room just did not cut it. However, it was clean and had a good bed. We also chose this property primarily because (a) it was free and (b) it was easy to drive from there to good beaches in O'ahu that aren't Waikiki. That said, otherwise this property was a solid Westin property. Staff were very courteous, including superior service at valet parking, which was our main concern. As I noted before, I used to live on O'ahu, and fortunately I already knew that Waikiki is the worst beach on this island and, as far as I know, throughout Hawaii. Although it has all of the tourist hotels, really, if you want a great experience on O'ahu, use Waikiki as your home base, and drive the 15-20min to other secluded beaches on the island. Since that was our plan, we mostly used the hotel for breakfast, where is a great buffet for $30 ($18 if you only eat cold food/continental). We also relaxed sometimes on the veranda in the middle of the property, where the pool and the excellent pool bar are. It is a beautiful area and one of the nicer layouts of the Waikiki properties. Compared to the Hilton, the Westin was also thankfully bereft of kids, which, since we don't have kids (it was our honeymoon) was important to us. The property is in excellent condition overall, and the fitness facility, while a bit tough to find (it's on the 32nd floor of the Sheraton tower, which is actually the 2nd floor, though not marked that way, and the signage is not great), was up to par and had all-new equipment. In sum, if I had a room with a balcony that was larger than a thimble, I would definitely stay in the Westin again. I would also stay there for free regardless. But, if I were paying their not-cheap rates, I would have been angry at the size of our room, but happy with everything else.

I would say that most of the other reviews on here give a reasonable portrait of the property. Nonetheless, there are a few things I'd like to point out that I think are important to booking a stay there.The good:- Grounds - The hotel is a lovely property. We found the room to be very spacious and very clean. A bit utilitarian (tile floors) but wise choices given the beach location. The beachfront itself is fantastic, some of the best in Puerto Rico. There are two pools which are very attractive. On both the beach and by the pools, there are always enough chairs.- Drinks - As others have noted, the bartenders make fantastic mojitos, pina coladas, and frozen mojitos. - Entertainment - Great tennis, golf, casino and lots of bars and restaurants. You certainly could have a pleasant vacation without leaving the grounds (though I would strongly advise going off grounds). The hotel can book virtually any activity for you (at their inflated prices, of course).- Family friendly - For those that have kids, it seems to be a great place for kids, but....The bad:- Kids - Obviously Easter weekend is the worst of the worst in terms of there being crowds and lots of families. The hotel does a great job of providing things for kids to do and it is a safe environment for them, generally, though we did see the hotel serving extremely young minors alcohol on one occasion. We stayed on the beach and away from the pool, where most of the kids were (even the quiet pool was full of screaming kids) so it did not bother us. They didn't make too much noise in the halls, though i could see that being an issue.- Service/Speed - I simply don't buy the concept of Caribbean time and as long as I am at an American-owned resort I consider extreme slowness and incompetence unacceptable. The hotel first tried to put us in an out-of-the-way room with two double beds until we complained and got the king we booked. Because the hotel is also the country club for wealthy locals, I repeatedly noticed that Puerto Rican locals were treated much better than out of town guests. The bartenders at the pool area were almost comically slow with drink service, to the point where other guests were yelling at them as they stood joking around, entering their tips into the computers, and otherwise not serving people. - Restaurants - The breakfast at Marbella was fairly good. We also had dinner at Aqualuna, the seafood place. It was pretty mediocre. Prices are basically on the higher end of New York prices, but the quality is not there - typical of a beach resort. Even for New Yorkers, we got some sticker shock when we saw that the Italian restaurant was charging nearly $30 for plates of pasta.There are several local places that are enjoyable, including Antojitos down the street. We also liked Las Vegas, just down the road, for dinner. We stayed here on Starwood points over a very busy weekend and were generally pleased with how the hotel handled the crowds. It was of course annoying that service was sometimes slow, and I was irked, though not surprised, at how much they nickel and dime you (nothing is complimentary, including in room internet). If you want an easy place to stay, it's a good place, and I note that on the following Monday (our last day) it got much quieter and more relaxing. Overall, not much about the place surprised me.

We are Starwood Preferred Guest members and thus were able to pay for part of our stay in points. Our main concern was having a quality hotel with a central, convenient location. This hotel is adjacent to Macquarie Bank and as such does a lot of corporate business; it is obviously more of a business-style hotel. That was fine with us - we had other portions of our trip for the more romantic/quaint type of thing. The rooms are ultamodern with electronic light and fixture controls, glassed-in bathrooms with extra large tubs and a separate shower, and a flat screen TV with sound that is pumped throughout the room. Everything in the room looked brand new and worked well. We did not order room service or use the restaurant other than for the breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of options including powerfood-type juice blends. The health club, as other posters have noted, is a bit far away from the modern, new tower (about a 5min walk across a catwalk on the third floor) but is excellently appointed. As it is a private gym and not merely the hotel's health club facility, it has all the features of a modern European-style health club, including a lap pool. We found the staff of the hotel to be extremely helpful and efficient, as one would expect of a Westin.The skylit, multi-story lobby is also very impressive.
