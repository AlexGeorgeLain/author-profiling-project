We paid $89 USD for a room with two beds and a balcony overlooking the Ala Wai Canal. RElatively roomy, well lit. Had a computer room where internet access was available and it was free to use. Nice little restaurant downstairs that served decent food and drinks and it wasn't very expensive either! There was also a little booth that sold some japanese food...also not expensive. All in all, i would definitley stay there again!
