Also halfway between shopping district and the older quarter. Very well kept and clean.Rooms are very funky and well appointed. Hotel can be a little noisy at times. Only problem we had was with security in the hotel's breakfast room. My daughters purse was snatched from the breakfast room by outsiders who were able to enter the hotel dining room despite a very non effective security man who stood outside the entrance to the breakfast room. Needless to say the experience somewhat soured our trip to Madrid.
