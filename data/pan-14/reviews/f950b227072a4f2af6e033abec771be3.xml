Conveniently located for the first time Barcelona tourist, the hotel is a compact jewel in many ways. Lovely lobby with dramatic hallways, glass interior elevators ascending through a pleasing water garden, and an attentive staff made the stay most enjoyable. But, as with all good things, there was a wrinkle or two. With a street side room, there was consistent late night traffic noise. The maid opened the windows for the first 2 or 3 days and required a desk person to come up and re-secure them with the special key. And the attractive bathroom sink took forever to drain. I advised the desk of this to no avail. Because of the ultra convenient location, probably stay at the Claris again although there are super alternatives in the immediate area.
