Hotel has good location, nice rooms, friendly staff, very modern and updated, good price, an over-all good experience. We emailed the hotel directly and received a decent pricing for a suite. Upon arrive the staff was friendly and continued that way through our three plus days. Rooms were big, clean, and updated. The hotel is located two/three blocks from the main square and a block from the Metro. The main district is in walking distance, plenty or stores, and places to eat. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good hotel with competitive price.
