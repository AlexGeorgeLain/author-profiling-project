I will say the front desk people were generally very helpful and friendly. We did have some minor problems with the room that need to be repaired (which we let the staff know about). The place is clean, usually has good rates for Miami, and has free airport shuttle (which was right on time). The free breakfast was average, and so crowded that there was no place to sit. Only 1 restaurant which is next door (Bennigans). But you end up with countless pizza menus shoved underneath your door all day long. One tip.....if you need to rent a car....EZ Rental is right next door inside the Embassy Suites....they are usually one of the cheaper places.....and since hardly any of the rental agencies are on airport grounds, you could take the hotel shuttle to the La Quinta and walk to the Embassy Suites (and return the car and walk back to hotel). Enterprise is across the street from the Embassy Suites also.
