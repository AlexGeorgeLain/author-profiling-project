And public transportation is just around the corner.Staff was very friendly.The room had a good size but it had an offensive smell....There is also a bar wich belongs to the Hotel, maybe interesting to mention that it is a gay-bar. But let me say, I've never seen some curious people in the hotel.Our room included Breakfast.I was a little bit surprised to get just ONE cupon for two persons about 5$ (not including the tax) so it was just impossible to get breakfast for two persons for this amount. Cupon was meant for a Restaurant just around the corner.... That's an absolute scream.Alltogether: It was okay for this stay. Next time I would search for another location to stay inn.
