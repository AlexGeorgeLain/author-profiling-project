It has many great facilities and is in a good (and quiet) location. Rooms are nice and the lobby is very attractive.Breakfast was exceptional however a bit expensive at each.I would probably stay here again if returning to Amsterdam.

Every aspect of the hotel met and exceeded our expectations.The location is superb being close to Empire State, Macy's etc. Staff were always very helpful and friendly. Internet room provided (free) was very well equiped. Rooftop terrace (bar at night) was just superb with great views to ESB and other buildings of interest. Gym is well equiped. Free continental breakfast was quite good and a bonus as most places it is extra - shame all of the plates and cutlery are throw aways!Overall loved the hotel (decor is lovely). Could not think of one negative aspect of the hotel in the time that we stayed. Would recommend highly.
