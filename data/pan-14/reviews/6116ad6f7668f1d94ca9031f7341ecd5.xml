As a Christmas present, my parents invited me along on their trip to this resort. They had purchased the trip through Apple Vacatons for the dates of Dec 11th thru the 16th. They also spent the extra money to make it an all inclusive stay- meaning we ate and drank for free, and received discounts at the spa and golf courses. After reading most of the unhappy reviews on here, I was quite shocked. I don't understand how anyone could say anything bad. Upon arrival, they upgraded me to an oceanview room on the same floor my parents were on (the 7th floor- top floor and the best views). Every employee would go out of their way for us. The maid came twice a day. The bartenders would remember us and our drinks. The waitresses and waiters were more attentive than I could have hoped. I realize that if we didn't have all-inclusive, the priced would be more than I would expect, but it is a resort- you have to expect things to be more pricy than home. I do suggest that you get that package if possible, its easier just to sign your name, than have to carry cash around. The beach is amazing, as well as the pool. I was waiting to be attacked by bugs after reading everyone's reviews. I had no problem, even though I forgot my bug spray. I found an empty chair everyday at the pool and beach. I can't rave about this place enough, except if you are single, this isn't really a place to consider staying. I'm 25 and didn't really see anyone my age (who wasn't there on a romantic getaway with their boyfriend/girlfriend). I do plan on going back with a friend or two next December. I just need to start saving now.
