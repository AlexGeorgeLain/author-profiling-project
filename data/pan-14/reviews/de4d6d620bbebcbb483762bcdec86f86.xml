Free shuttle bus from the airport.Good size room, nice clean with a great bed. Check in staff were friendly helpful, as was the concierge.We ordered the continental style breakfast, room service. This was the typical selection of pastries, cereal, fruit bowl, juice coffee. This was absolutely outstanding - beautiful fresh OJ, truly fresh pastries fruit bowl that actually had plenty of lovely ripe berries - not just some old melon. All up a terrific stay.
