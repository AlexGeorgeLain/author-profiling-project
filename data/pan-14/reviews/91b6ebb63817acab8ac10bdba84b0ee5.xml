This was another trip for me taking two teenage boys to London for the weekend. Check in was friendly, efficient and had no problems whatsoever. Our wishes when booking were hounered-interconnecting, with one twin and one double. I do tend to have some trouble usually with hotels on this request so it was nice to not even have to ask. The rooms themselves were large very clean and modern, although better suited to business travelers which is expected with the area and had absolutely no complaints on this front; and with very nice views and clear mornings to wake up to was a bonus. The service itself could not be faulted, all the staff were friendly and met any requests with courtesy and efficiency.Breakfast is brilliant, filling us all up till late afternoon, which is another bonus when you have fussy kids with you. The only thing I had qualms about, which was not the hotels fault in any way was that to get into the more central part of London, your only option is the dlr and the underground, which is not always convenient to travelling around. All in all I would probably stay here on my own, as there is not much to do for younger ones in the area, but this is Hilton hotel as it should be.
