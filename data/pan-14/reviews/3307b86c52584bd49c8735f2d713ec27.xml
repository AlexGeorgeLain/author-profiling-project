Discounted the posh places, and booked 6 nights here and were not disappointed. Decor is very Hawaiian and very pink, but we're not at home are we. The room was spacious (2 queen beds); bathroom a bit small and dated, but adequate. The balcony was large enough to have breakfast, or a bottle of wine and watch the surfers across the road, or the sunset over the beach. We were on the 17th floor overlooking the beach.The Breakfast on the Beach concept is a good one; you can usually find something to get you started (juice, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, pastries, 2 hot offerings, tea and coffee). The best part is that it is included in the price of the room. The hotel has lots of families, so it's best to take your breakfast to the beach or your room as the pool area at breakfast time can get a bit crowded. The location is great, close to everything; lots of buses and trolleys close by.
