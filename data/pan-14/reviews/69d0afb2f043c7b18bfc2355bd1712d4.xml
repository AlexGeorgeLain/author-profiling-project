From the moment you check in, the Lombardy family treats you as a personal friend who's come to stay a few days -- providing information on the city, excellent restaurant recommendations, help with tour reservations, etc. -- not just an anonymous source of revenue. They are in the middle of the city, just two blocks from the Duomo and no more than a 10 minute walk from most of the major museums and sites. Our room was spacious for Europe and, while not luxurious, was comfortable and well set up. Free internet access via WiFi throughout the hotel or from a terminal next to the office is a big plus, as is the small bar area where you can get wine, water and soft drinks at very reasonable prices. Their substantial continental breakfast is served in a room with a frescoed ceiling, adding to the sense of history that permeates central Florence.
