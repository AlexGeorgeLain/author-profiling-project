Excellent 'trattorias' close by. We paid extra for the balcony, well worth it and so relaxing after the tourist queues.Close by is the Medici Riccardi chapel, a must even on a short visit. The renovated halls in the Pitti Palace have some top master pieces. And for history enjoy a walk around Sta Croce church. Bacchus in the Bargello is more handsome than the well promoted David [and no queues]
