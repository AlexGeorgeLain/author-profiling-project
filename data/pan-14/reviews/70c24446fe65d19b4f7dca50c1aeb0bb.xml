I stayed with my 18 year old daughter and we both loved the hotel, Barcelona and the total experience. Barcelona is hip, design is paramount and this is all exemplified in this hotel. But the factor that differentiates this hotel is the staff - they were the best I have come across in a hotel. We stayed for 3 nights on a world trip and we felt very comfortable here. The suite is utilitarian and refreshingly different to normal hotel rooms. The room is a little dark, although we were there in winter! Large bathrooms.We were very centrally located, and within walking distance to all we wanted to see and do - we did lots of walking and discovered lovely tapas bars, restaurants etc I required a package to be posted to Australia, and the front desk fixed up the whole thing (packaging and postage) very painlessly for me.The open snack bar is such a welcoming addition to the hotel, it adds that homely feel for the traveller.Highly recommended.
