Probably one of the nicest, most modern rooms and spotlessly clean. Just across the road from the Anhalter station or a short taxi ride from the Hauptbahnhof.Just a short walk to Checkpoint Charlie and even a shorter to the remaining 200 metres of the Wall. Potsdammer Platz is also within walking distance.Very good Italian restaurant (Ristorante Marinelli) on the corner in the hotel building.
