So winning a work competition to visit again in 2006 with my colleagues was a real bonus.This hotel was ideal, away from the main hustle and bustle, but well located near to some major Guadi attractions and the diagonal metro station- that linked you to all parts of this stunning city.My single room was internal, but had a comfortable double bed and didn't leave you wanting for any other comfort. The breakfast was phenomenal, with every type of item imaginable in a buffet style, and the roof top terrace, with sun loungers, lime trees and a pool, was ideal for relaxing. There was even a gym in the basement- although this was a little haphazard in set-up.Although I have little clue as to the cost of staying here, as it was on the company- I can confirm that it was an incredibly comfortable stay and the location was great.
