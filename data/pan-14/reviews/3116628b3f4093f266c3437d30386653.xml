I stayed here for five nights in April attending a conferenceand occupied two different rooms. Here's my experience:--long check-in lines--no offer of help with luggage--unhelpful front desk staff--small cramped rooms--sagging mattresses! even in the new tower rooms --poor housekeeping (mold and hair in bathroom)--nearby mall only has half the stores open and limited food court--$12 cab ride to French QuarterThe positive was that it was nice to be on the river and be able to walk along it. In the daytime, you could walk (20+ minutes) or take the trolley to the French Quarter. This was really nice because of the outdoor music festival. Normally I do not think it would be a big consideration.The conference itself seemed to go smoothly. Cookies were good and soda replenished frequently. Public spaces were attractive in a generic convention hotel way.My colleagues ate in the sports bar and did not like their food. Room service breakfast for two was good if expensive ($80 for french toast, bacon, omelet and extra large tea pot)Pillows were good and the hotel did provide bed board on request but the mattress still sagged so much I woke up stiff. I have never had this experience at any other hotel including some much less expensive than this one. It was really shocking how poor the mattress was.Given the other better choices in New Orleans I cannot imagine anyone choosing to stay here voluntarily.If you have to stay here for a conference, book WAY ahead of time and reserve a tower king bed room (larger than other) with direct river view.
