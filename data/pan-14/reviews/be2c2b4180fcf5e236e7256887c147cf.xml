A good fun district, and within walking distance of many major attractions.Some rooms are very small but we were fortunate to get a small so-called 'suite' with room for three (with only two staying). Corridors were amazingly narrow.Beds were very comfortable, and the windows double glazed, mainly for soundproofing from the people crowded streets below. Breakfast dining room not recommended, and it was more fun to eat at the pattisserie right next door.The man on the front desk was very helpful, but a female person was not so good.Recommeded.Geoff H , Noosa, Australia
