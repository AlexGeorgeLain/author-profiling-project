The hotel is situated only 3-5 minutes walk (depends on the weight of your luggage) away from the Inaricho Subway Station ( Ginza line) which is perfect as it takes you to the heart of Tokyo in only 10mins. It's also about 10-12 mins away from the Ueno Jr station.I arrived at the hotel at about 2.20 and the girl at the reception (who spoke really good English) was happy to check if my room was ready (check in time is 3pm) and gave me the key. I had to pay 1000 yen as a 'key deposit' before i was given the key to my room though.The room size was ok and so was the toilet. You had all the usual accessories in the room including the toothbrush, soap, shampoo, slippers and even a robe. The bed was ok as I cant recall being in any kind of discomfort. They had the air conditioning unit with a remote control that was not working. I did not bother calling the reception about it but i am sure they would have fixed it for me if i had. They had 3 pcs with free internet (inc Skype) in the lounge but it was busy most of the time as you'd imagine. Also you can borrow various accessories that aren't included in your room like iron or whatever else you need. I asked for an Ironing board and an iron and was allowed to take it to my room.When I had to cut my stay short the manager (French chap) was very kind and did not take a cancellation fee of me although it was way past the check-out time. Overall, I reckon its good value for money although i did stay in better budget hotels in Japan/Tokyo with only a slightly higher price range. If Ueno/Asakusa is the place where you would want to spend a day or two i would definitely recommend it.
