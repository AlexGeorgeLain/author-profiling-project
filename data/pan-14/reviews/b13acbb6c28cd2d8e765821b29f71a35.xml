Staying there two w/ends in a row with my family, I was frustrated when they couldn't put us in adjoining rooms. We were hungry having gotten off the plane and after twenty minutes in one of the restaurants the server allowed as how, 'we're slammed. It'll probably be an hour before I get to you. We went up to our room to call room service which answered after twenty minutes. I agree about the breakfast and how expensive everything is, not worth it in my opinion.Next time I would look elsewhere.
