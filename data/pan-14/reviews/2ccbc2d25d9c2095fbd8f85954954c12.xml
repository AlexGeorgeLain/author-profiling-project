We enjoyed Culebra and Tamarindo Estates.Very secluded and private.The main road to the hotel is now paved with easy access and lovely beaches.The snorkeling is nice,but not spectacular.The rooms are comfortable,but in the warmers months,not quite practical.We would have loved to have cooked in the kitchen,but only the bedrooms have A/C and are the only respite from the heat of the day.A/C to all areas of the units would be much nicer in addition to providing satellite TV to the living area to utilise that area better.The good news is there was a nice porch on our unit,(upstairs,overlooking the bay.Theres so much to see that the bad parts were small disapointments overall.In the cooler months,I would stay there again in a heartbeat!
