It is expensive, true, and the rooms are small, but it is in a fantastic location, the rooms are very well appointed and the service is good. This hotel is in the 'trying to be achingly hip' category, and although I suspect the decor will date quickly, it pretty much succeeds.The location is right on the Plaza Santa Ana, which has all the buzz you expect from downtown Madrid. Despite our room overlooking the square, we were not disturbed by the noise except briefly on Saturday night after Real Madrid had just won a match and were likely to win the league.The room was very comfortable with a huge TV, sound system, DVD player, and electrical points for the UK and US as well as Europe. Bathroom with Aveda shampoo etc. The service was very good - UK newspapers in the morning, a turn-down service in the evening, decent breakfast, friendly staff.We did not eat in the restaurant other than for breakfast as there are hundreds of bars and restaurants within 100m of the hotel. We had a drink in the 'Penthouse' bar which was quite cool and stylish, with good views of Madrid.Definitely worth a visit, but don't expect budget prices.
