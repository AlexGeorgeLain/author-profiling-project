		<document id="fcbafbb32536cfefdba416f5377e6f3c" url=""><![CDATA[Old world grandeur Old world grandeur at this downtown hotel. Rooms are varied in size. Our smoking club floor room was very large; immaculate with a European decor flavor. The downside was the one person only bathroom with its ancient fixtures in really urgent need of upgrade. That is just a heads-up, not enough of a problem to keep you away.Staff was nice, courteous...almost. Their Sports Bar was very busy; the staff was unable to cope with the situation exemplified by the person answering the phone stating they were too busy to answer how long a wait there was for a table there. Fortunately, there are other choices in the hotel as well as nearby.If you are looking for a downtown hotel, the property is a good option. (Especially if you are into buying wholesale jewelry since the jewelry marts are close by.)
