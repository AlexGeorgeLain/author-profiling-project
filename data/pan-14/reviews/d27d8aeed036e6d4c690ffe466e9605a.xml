While tipping is discouraged it produces remarkable results. The beach and pool area are kept in top condition.The reception staff were very accommodating as were the ground and security people. However the main dining wasn't just dirty it was filthy.Every table came with a compliment of flies. Food that had fallen to the floor at breakfast was still there at dinner.This is truly a shame as this place is basically very beautiful. I don't think I would go back or use any other Super Club property.
