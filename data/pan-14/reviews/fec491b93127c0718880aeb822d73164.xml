The hotel was clean, the staff friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts plentiful and fresh. This hotel is really well situated, being very near to a tram stop, and within walking distance of good places to eat and shop. It's in a quiet leafy street, and although the beds are small, the room was fine for a short stay, and the bathroom has a powerful shower, with plenty of hot water.
