It was comparable to most American hotels I've stayed in at that price/star-level, with, of course, much smaller rooms. But as I understand, that's just Europe for you. Plus, we didn't go to Amsterdam to sit in our room. Interestingly enough, the bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom - which was a good thing since you DO need more room in there.Found the location to be very nice - close to Centraal Station, close to lots of shops and cheaper eateries (we only went to one restaurant before realizing how expensive things were). As for the threat of crime around the area - it doesn't even compare to many American cities I've been in (New Orleans, St Louis, Memphis, etc). Of course, that's just a gut feeling. We never felt threatened, but still made sure to keep our eyes open for trouble.I guess if I were used to 5 star hotels where money is no option, this would be a disappointment. But really, I just wanted a clean, convenient place to stay and that's exactly what I got. Also, at the time, you could get rooms here through Priceline for pretty cheap.
