Beautifully and tastefully decorated, friendly and helpful front desk staff with a quiet environment. Beautiful public spaces provide wireless service. The self-serve breakfast was disappointing as to variety, quantity and presentation and not comparable to other B Bs in other parts of the world of similar accommodation standard. Essentially, the breakfast was not appropriate for the elegance of the hotel. Considering the disappointing breakfast and the minimal square footage of the room the tariff is a bit pricey. Apparently the owner feels that proximity to Times Square is worth the 5-star prices for a 4-star property. Excellent bathroom. If being over-priced by about 15% is not a concern then this is the place to stay in Manhattan.
