However, it is well located, fair price, clean. They can enhance the quality of the bedclothes and pillows. Additional fees are parking (USD 10) and safe (USD 1). The only thing that I consider bad was the shower, which we have to waste long time because the water flow is very, very weak. I recommend, and I would stay there again.
