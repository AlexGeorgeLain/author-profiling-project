If you want to go on banana boats all day and don't mind being hassled all the time then you might like it...If you want to swim in polluted water with hundreds of jet skis and speed boats or stay in the resort (assuming you have a cast iron stomache) all the time then consider this as an option otherwise go to Kuta, Seminyak or any of the hundreds of other nice beaches in BaliThe hotel was overbooked when we arrived and as a nice touch they upgraded our room to a villa - not exactly a villa but a sort of one room apartment - the first night was free since this was there mistake but in broken English we were told that we could stay in the villa for an extra $70 which sounded very reasonable and we were happy not to have to move again after the tiring journey...Half way through the stay we decided to check how much room service and drinks were because we didn't want a horrible shock at the end - we then found out that the upgrade was $70 dollars a night despite what we had been told on check in... ahhh!!Needless to say we moved back with some difficulty to the standard room that was actually more comfortable and at first we told they were doing us a big favour in allowing us to do this...As I have seen from other reviews its all fine until you have a problem and then they won't budge - overall their poor attitude at rectifying problems caused is saddening and frustrating and leaves a very sour taste in your mouth...We spoke with the management many times and they eventually offered us a 20% discount on the upgrade costs - this was a small consolation really since we were in a family group with 3 rooms and spent a huge amount on drinks etc. Infact the discount offered didn't even cover the cost of the food that upset our stomaches - great service!The resort is a nice place - but Nusa Dua beach is a dump and the restaurant consistently upset our stomaches - seriously Kuta is a big improvement and much cleaner despite the crowds.Also you should know it takes about 30 minutes in taxi (8-15 $US) to get to Kuta or Seminyak and the number of reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance is very limited.I am very confused as to why Nusa Dua is the home to a lot of the upmarket Hotels - you would expect the beach to be nicer than Kuta et al - honestly it's not even close...Barely is a lovely place and the local people are mostly really nice but choose where you stay carefully or it may cast a distinct shadow over your holiday.
