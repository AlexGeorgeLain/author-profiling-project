I see that small rooms are normal in NY, but not here. They are about the average size you would expect outside of the city. The location is also excellent for Time Square and Bryant Square. Subway on the corner and right next to a Dele and an Irish Bar (good pub grub at a reasonable cost). If walking is not a problem to you then you are perfect in this hotel for all the local attractions. Macys is about 10 mins as is 5th ave. Time Square 3 mins and central park about 15 mins. If I return to NY, I will look this hotel up right away. Staff were all friendly and helpfull without exception. One thing missing is a restaurant on the premises for evening meals and snacks, but with so much on offer outside, this is no big deal and there is a breakfast room and this was very clean, smart and with a good selection.
