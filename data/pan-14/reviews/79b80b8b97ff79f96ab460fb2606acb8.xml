Even though it is very big, the service was great and the staff were exceptional. The lagoon pool is really pretty and we enjoyed lazing around it with a few dips to cool off. The grounds are kept immaculate and lovely to walk round. The view from the reception area was just amazing. Our guide Putu was brilliant and we had a personalised tour all round the island for the day. My only down comments would be that the beach and sea did not come up to my expectations and we thought the resturant prices were a bit high. Would we go again, most definitely.
