I went back to reception and asked for another room. We were given one on the 4th floor much nicer but again shabby and bathroom not the cleanest.Nice touches like dressing gown and slippers though.Food was great especially breakfast.We had the half board premium package so our evening meal was allready paid for.I would advise people to take an half board option as eating out there is very expensive.Anyone with babies take some jars with you.
