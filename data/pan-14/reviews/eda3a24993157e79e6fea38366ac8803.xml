I have been to Amsterdam many times, but for this trip I wanted something really special and happenstance led me to this site and the Seven Bridges! I have never been happier with a European hotel. Everything about it was great, including the location, the hotel and of course, the service. My girlfriend fell in love with the place as soon as she saw it . Together we have stayed in hostels, hotels and campsites throughout Europe, USA and Canada... but she was most impressed with this hotel. It is a warm, welcoming place and we both felt at home from the moment we entered the lobby. The flowers smelled wonderful, the breakfast was beyond expectations and worth every Euro. The room we stayed in (Number 10) was cozy, quiet, romantic and felt more like our own apartment than a hotel. I have stayed at the Peabody in Memphis, the Mariott in nyc and the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal, but the hotel I look most forward to staying at again is The Seven Bridges in Amsterdam. Don't miss it !
