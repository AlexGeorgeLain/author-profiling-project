We stayed on the 12th floor and have no complaints. We are fairly fussy, but were pleased with the immaculate housekeeping, the responsiveness of the staff, and the location of the hotel. We had no problem with noise at night. I do agree that the rooms can be somewhat warm, but we turned on the air conditioner which had the dual purpose of providing white noise to block any potential sounds. The bathroom was not large, but certainly was adequate and up to date.The fridge was handy, though we never used the microwave or coffee maker.The location was terrrific for midtown. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel or returning to it another time.

I picked it based on the reviews for a one night theatre/restaurant/hotel package. For the other three nights in Toronto I gambled on Hotwire for a 4* hotel ($88) and was given the Intercontinental on Front Street. There is no comparison between the two. The beds at the Mariott were uncomfortable and the sheets felt like sandpaper (compared to our previous three nights at the Intercontinental).The room was much smaller and less attractive. The hotel is adequate, clean, and deserving of 3*. Yes there is a pool, relatively small and shallow throughout; but my daughter did get to swim. No complaints about the staff. I am not sure what is particularly desirable about the location. It is adjacent to the huge mall and in a busy downtown area; not walking distance to the theatre, waterfront, skydome, or CN tower.
