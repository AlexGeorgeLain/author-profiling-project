We had intended to stay four nights but had to leave early due to illness. We plan to return to Seattle next year but I would not stay at this hotel again. It was quite shabby both outside and in and it does not appear that the hotel is kept up very well. I did not realize that the hotel was so close to busy roads and the window of our room looked out over the highway traffic. The room was very small, cramped with the bed taking up all of the space. The room was barely clean, not well furnished, the mattress old and the bedding sparse. We found the room to be rather depressing and the bathroom was also small. The elevators were unreliable. Although the parking was free, hotel staff could not guarantee that we would have a space if we left with our car and returned. This made us feel nervous about leaving the hotel with our car. The breakfast was very plentiful, more choices of food than I've seen at most hotels but the room was very crowded, unpleasant looking and it was difficult to manuever around everything. The layout of the hotel is awkward as well. It appears that the hotel needs a complete renovation. I learned a lesson from staying here that in the future I will pay an extra $20.00+ per night if necessary and stay in a place that has a clean, attractive and cheery atmosphere with rooms large enough to move around in. I did appreciate that when we had to check out of the hotel earlier than planned, we were not charged for the two nights we had planned to stay.
