Check-in went smoothly and we had no problem with the girls at check-in. They were helpful and friendly. We were suppossed to have a cabana room but there was some confusion with our reservation and our room was given away. We were accomodated with a room on the 12th floor overlooking Graumans Chinese Theater with the hollywood sign in the background. I definately recommend it. We couldn't have asked for better. The room we had was big and we loved the decor. The old lobby is dark but I agree that it adds to the mystique and style of the hotel. We ate at 25 degrees a couple times and LOVED it. Make sure to eat there. It is a bit pricey but worth the money for the best burger I have ever had. We were staying in the hotel during the premier for the movie 300, which was at Graumans. It was exciting to watch the red carpet from our room. The post-premier party was at our hotel on the old lobby floor. They were setting up for most of the day and shut off access from the elevators to this floor. That was a bit of a pain but that's the Roosevelt. Staying at the roosevelt you just have to understand that a lot of events are held there.The pool area and tropicana bar are beautiful. I am sure the cabana rooms and great to stay in too.
