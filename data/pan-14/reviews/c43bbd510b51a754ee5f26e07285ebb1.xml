The concerge desk is unfriendly and rude when asked time taken on the way back to get to airport via taxi. Very standoffish. I stayed in the 1 bedroom condo. Upon 'glance' appearance, it is very nice looking. Many spots on the ceiling from water damage and oil spots. Bed was comfortable. Shower disguistingly dirty with mold apparent. Soaker tub was not clean as hairs found. I was woken up via phone by the housekeeping staff asking what time I would be checking out. Then an hour later the staff knocked on the door and asked again when I would be checking out. Quite the disturbance. The pool is dirty with brown stains on the bottom. I would not walk about bare foot around the pool as it also looked unkempt. This hotel is a sad attempt at renovating a very old building.I would rather pay the same expensive rate and get my moneys worth elsewhere.
