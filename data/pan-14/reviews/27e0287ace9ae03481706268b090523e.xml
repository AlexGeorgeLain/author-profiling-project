Without a doubt, Sofitel is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Knowing how New York hotel rooms are often described as small, these hotel bedrooms are big even by UK standards. Great location, great hotel, helpful and friendly staff - can't wait to go back. If you get the opportunity and are visiting November or December, the Radio City Christmas Spectacular is not to be missed. An outstanding show, unique to New York. If you want to really splash out, a visit to Tavern On The Green in Central Park is a real experience. Quite pricey but an exceptional restaurant, especially at Christmas time when the decorations are unbelievable.

It may only be a 3* but probably deserves a higher rating because of the high standard of decor and cleanliness. The fact it was a totally non-smoking property adds to the freshness and comfort of the hotel. Buffet breakfast was more than adequate and gives you a good start to the day. Metro being close by saved the 15 minute walk to and from Las Ramblas. We definitely would stay here again.
