Don't be decived the outside of this hotel is nice and it is right on the beach with a great location, the inside is nice buy the lobby and the shopd are nice also. the aquarium inside needs a good cleaning, and when you go to your room the wall paper is falling off the walls the lights and crooked and there is a smell. once in the room although we had a great view the bedding was old the bathroom was gross, cabinets were loose it was just crap. i guess we mostly paid for our view and not for a great room. we were in the beach tower. i would not reccomend to anyone. i wouldn't even come to ohau again. maybe to see pearl harbor if you've never been and the sea life park raoyal dolphin swim was amazing but it's really busy here and if you are looking for a more hawaiian feeling and laid back feeling go straight to Ka'anapali beach Club in Maui, this is the place to stay, 10 stars compared to the pacific beach hotel. i would never come here again!!!!!
