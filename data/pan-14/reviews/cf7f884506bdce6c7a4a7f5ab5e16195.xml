Upon arrival, which was earlier than expected, the hotel had not yet cleaned the room that I had booked. They had no problem finding another and making sure everything was taken care of. The staff was great and the location....awesome! Located right next to the Monge Metro, traveling to and from the hotel during the day was easy and convenient. Our room was on the 3rd floor and had a nice little view of the surrounding streets and buildings that make up the Latin Quarter. The rooms were a little on the small size but nothing to really worry about, i'm told that's what to expect in Europe. Only complaint was that our room, located right next to the street, was a bit noisy at times but nothing that made the experience less enjoyable. One thing I was really pleased with was the computer down stairs with an internet connection that was available for use. I have to stay on top of my Fantasy Football! haha All together, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Paris. Great place with an excellent staff, location, and rooms!
