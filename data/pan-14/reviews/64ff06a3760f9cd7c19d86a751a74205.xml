We asked for and got interconnecting rooms, one with a double bed the other twin beds. Both rooms were large and well equipped. The bathrooms were of a reasonable size.The hotel was very clean and well decorated throughout. We made good use of the swimming pool and sauna during our visit.The hotel Grill Bar was great for a well earned drink after a long days sightseeing and the restuarant provided an excellent evening meal.The staff were always helpful and the conceirge provided excellent advice as to other good places to eat and visit. We had breakfast in 'Lefties' right next door, excellent food at a good price.The Handlery is very well situated in the Theatre District just yards from Union Square, giving good access to shops and the Cable Cars.Only negative was the price of parking - $36 overnight - but I learnt there were other much cheaper alternatives very close by.During our vacation we stayed at 5 different hotels on the West and East Coast and this was the best all round Hotel. An excellent Hotel which I would not hestitate to visit again or recommend to others.
