The hotel staff was more than accomidating in helping me with this request. I found the property to be urban chic with great artwork, decor, photos, and lighting. The bed was great and the room was quite clean. I do get a bit annoyed with paying $17 for parking when most of the airport lots in the area have lower daily rates. They really ought to lower the rate for a guest. I ordered room service one morning and found the food to be delivered hot and fast. The menu was good for all diets and had a nice selection. Overall I found this place to be a fine choice for your airport hotel needs. It's also great for early morning departures from LAX. Give the place a try, you will not be disappointed. It's usually a few bucks cheaper than the Marriott that is a quarter mile down the road on Century Blvd.
