The hotel's location was very convenient for sight seeing around San Francisco, close to numerous places to eat and drink, a cable car ride and many major department stores were all within walking distance. The purpose of our holiday was to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and on arrival we were greeted by John Handlery (Vice Pres) and a bottle of champagne and a basket of friut etc, were bought to our room. We found the overall experience very enjoyable and would recommend this hotel to others.One small complaint. Our room had no wardrobe space, although this may had been different had we been staying longer.

It is situated adjacent to numerous bars, restaurants, shops etc, and only a five minute walk to the beach.Our room was spacious. It had a fridge , a cooker, a microwave and a tea and coffee maker.It also had a balcony, ample storage space and a TV.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful at all times.Some people complained about the traffic noise at night but I dont think this is justified. It's the price you pay for a central location.One down side. Not enough elevators. This wasn't a problem for most of the day, but during busy periods, you would have to wait awhile.
