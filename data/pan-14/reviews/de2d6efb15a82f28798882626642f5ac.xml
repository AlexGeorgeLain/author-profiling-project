I wish we would have spent the extra $50 to stay in a decent place.It took 45 minutes to check in and we were the only ones in the lobby. The clerk kept answering the phone and talking to people as the walked up. I had reserved two rooms on the hotel's website, but she would not honor the price and charged us more for the rooms.Once we walked the gauntlet, a maze of poorly light outdoor hallways, we found our windowless room. The linens were dirty and the thin metal door let in all of the noise from outside. There were a lot of punks hanging out and getting high throughout the hotel.While I could stay here alone, I would NEVER take a family here.

The pool is great for kids and the beach is a short walk from the hotel. The small casino was not crowded during the week and the breakfast buffet was above average.Like most Embassy Suites, the rooms were clean and the staff was attentive.Overall, a great place to stay for a day or two before leaving Puerto Rico.On a side note, I've read some reviews about the expensive taxis to Old San Juan and recommending renting a car. This is a fine idea if you are going to tour part of the island, but if you are planning on only going to Old San Juan you can take the bus for $0.75 each way. It takes 45 minutes, but it is a straight shot.
