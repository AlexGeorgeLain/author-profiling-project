We arrived from Sydney after a long flight and were greeted by very friendly reception staff. Whilst my friend was checking in we were given a map of the local area by the tour desk and told how to book any tours we might need. We had already booked our Universal Studios tour and it needed to be confirmed with the supplier which the Tour Desk was happy to do on our behalf even though we hadn't booked it there. The room was clean, very comfortable and we had plenty of space. The hotel is just up the road from The Highland Centre and Hollywood Boulevard, so a great location! We found the staff couldn't do enough for us. When they found out we were off to Universal Studios they gave us a map and suggestions of what to see there! A great hotel, highly recommended!
