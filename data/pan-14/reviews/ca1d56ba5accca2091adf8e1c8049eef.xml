After flying into Girona we got the bus into Barcelona the hotel was easy to find. It was very late at night but we didn't feel intimidated 'though we walked past a few very 'interesting' night clubs bars.The rooms at the hotel were spotlessly clean. Complimentary soap, shower/bath gel toothbrushes were replenished on a daily basis.The reception bar staff were extremely helpful the breakfasts were more than we needed to keep us going through long sightseeing days. We ate in the restaurant bar both were excellent value for money.If we go back to Barcelona we will go back in December for the Christmas Market outside the Cathedral the street entertainment.
