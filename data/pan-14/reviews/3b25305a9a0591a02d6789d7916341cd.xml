In very spacious fireplace room on my own, despite booking cheapest internet rate on site. Very helpful front desk staff, enjoyed the evening eats and wine tasting. San Francisco greeter also terrific. Great location. Walked my legs off but close to cable cars/bus as well. Very floral for a guy on his own but would happily go back with wife.
