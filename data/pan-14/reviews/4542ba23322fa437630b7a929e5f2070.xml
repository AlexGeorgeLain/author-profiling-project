The last one that I stayed in was like this and so I assumed they all were.Mistake.Upon entering the room, I thought that I had lost a room as I couldn't find a bed. Eventually I realized that it just had a sofabed, which was a bit of a pain to open and close each night and not as comfortable as a normal bed. Maybe I'm just lazy.I thought that the room was showing a bit too much wear and tear as well, although it was clean.On the plus side, it has a great location right on La Ramblas - just about as central as you can get.Also the fact that there was free cable internet inside the room was a major godsend as I had to work a lot during my 'holiday'.In summary, three stars is probably too few for this apart-hotel, but four stars are probably too many. I guess it all depends on how important having a 'real' bed is to you.
