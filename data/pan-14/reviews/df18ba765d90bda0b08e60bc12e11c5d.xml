As stated in other reviews the hotel is stylish and modern chic. Staff were great, nothing too much trouble.Breakfast is OK, but a bit prices, there are plenty of coffee places adjacent offering good food at the price.The ONLY drawback was the very short clothes rail, only 5 or 6 inches, not enough for too many items, a real design oversight. They supplied a iron and ironing board so I could press a shirt each day (as I hang them) but this may be a pain if you have a few suits or lots of dresses, shirts, i.e staying for more than just a few nights. If the above is no issue, then this place is 5/5 all the way. And the location is simply fantastic, bars, restaurants, easy walking to lots of the centre and adjacent to the metro.Berlin was wonderful, well worth a visit and the people everywhere were great. We booked via lastminute.com and got a free upgrade to slightly larger than standard.Once you have booked, phone and reserve your room. Unfortunately the Germans are still big smokers so none smoking rooms are not the norm, phone and reserve.
