Breakfast was included in the rate and offered a great choice. The real honeycomb was a bonus!We took advantage of the Anne Frank House tickets which are valid in the evenings after 5pm - no queuing at all, and recommended.The staff were unbelieveably friendly - and seemed genuine too. We will certainly be staying there again.
