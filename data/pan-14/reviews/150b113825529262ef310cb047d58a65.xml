We thought that the room was fairly large compared to the other New York hotels we have stayed in (Hilton Times Square and Century Paramount). The room had two double beds, two windows, was non-smoking, light and airy, clean and well decorated. We had no problems whatsoever with the lifts, in fact one of the side lifts was right by our room door but there was no noise from it. The location was superb and the staff were efficient and friendly. We would definitely stay here on any return visit to NY. Congratulations to the management and staff.
