This hotel is fabulous, if you are looking for a venetian style hotel then look no further, The rooms are so opulently furnished, and the bed was huge !!!! A Super kingsize whopper. With beautiful egyptian cotton bedlinen. Beautiful curtains, large wardrobes, safe, and the bathroom was fabulous too! including a huge flat 'rain shower' plus a lovely bath, sound system if you are listening to the TV/Radio and a telephone in there too! The hotel itself does only have a little bar, and a lovely breakfast room, where the breakfasts were interesting and filling. A beautiful buffet service and incredibly helpful staff.The location is brilliant, just a short walk around the corner to the Rialto bridge, a perfect location, whilst it did not overlook a canal, it made up with everything else. If you like small hotels, with lavish furnishings this is the one, it is beautiful!
