We were on the 28th floor and had a lovely view of the area. Although the hotel is huge (44 or 45 floors, I believe), it did not feel impersonal because the staff were so friendly. However, colleagues were who staying in another room were not able to check-in until 5:30pm because their room wasn't ready. Since 3:00pm was the permitted check-in, a 2.5 hour delay seemed quite unreasonable. (Perhaps the hotel needs to hire a few more people for its cleaning staff?) The restaurant was fine (we ate breakfast and lunch there), despite NYC prices for food ($15 for two eggs, for example, w/ toast and potatoes), although we went outside for dinner. All in all, a very good place for a convention participant.
