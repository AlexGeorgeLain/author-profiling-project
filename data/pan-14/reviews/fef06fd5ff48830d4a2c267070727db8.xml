When we were there the two bartenders in the pub were very friendly (salim? and Ninka) met some cool people and even watched Liverpool vs Chelsea one nite. The beds were comfotable and the shower/bathroom were more than enough for us.Taking the bus is really easy! It is a solid 15 minutes out to Centraal.Tell them at check in you dont want the mini-bar...just by moving an item they will charge you. We had them empty it and filled it with our own items. Breakfast buffet is fair (had it once). It will be tough to find a 99 euro/nite hotel as decent, as this place. goood bargain. Dont fret about the bus its a great way to see and meet people.
