The rooms are a good size for a major city and cleverly-designed to make the most of space. The shower was excellent and the bed was very comfortable. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Also, I thought room service and the minibar were reasonably-priced. Breakfast was really good too.The location was really useful - within 15 minutes we could walk to Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotic, and the Passag de Gracia (where many of the Gaudi buildings are). Also, it's only half a block from a metro station, where the airport bus also sets down.The best bit is probably the rooftop area with a lovely shady deck and a pool for cooling off and chilling out (more like a big jacuzzi though - you can't really swim in it).There were a few niggles - the sink and bath didn't drain properly unless we took the plug out. Also the noise from the park outside really intruded in the evening, since all the neighbourhood kids were playing there, very loudly. Thankfully they did all go to bed by the time we wanted to go to bed. But overall, I was really happy with our stay and would definitely stay again.
