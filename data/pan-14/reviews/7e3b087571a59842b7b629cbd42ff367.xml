This was a post-night of a cruise tour package and we didn't have a choice where we stayed, but I would stay here again if I ever find myself in Amsterdam. Not sure what thet hotel normally charges, but we paid $430.00 through the travel agent, which I feel is outrageous. Breakfast was included, but restaurant didn't open until 7:00 am, and we had to leave at 7:00 for the airport, so we missed breakfast.The location was excellent (right down the street from the museums, and across the street from a square). Room was comfortable well equipped. Bathroom was well lit (important to me) and would take an adaptor for a curling iron. The only problem (other than price) was that it was Sunday and their restaurant was not open for dinner. We were both feeling under the weather and didn't feel like venturing out that evening, but had no choice. Also, they charge for internet use, which at the rates we paid, I would expect for free.
