We decided to visit Excellence Punta Cana after staying at Couples Negril, Sandals Negril and Cancun in the past. We studied up a good bit before making our final decision and spent a lot of time on Trip Advisor. Luckily, we made the right decision as Excellence was the best all-inclusive we have ever visited! ALL the food was incredible, the staff was awesome, and the place is GORGEOUS! All the pictures I've seen just do not do the place justice. We were a little paranoid after reading some of the old reviews when Secrets still owned the place, but Excellence has done an incredible job since they took over in January (I think that's when it was). They're well on their way to achieving their 5-star rating. The place is just top-notch all the way around.The only complaint we have is about the bugs... there are tiny little things that bite you and leave marks for days and ITCH like crazy, so bring some repellent and you'll be good to go! I posted some pics at www.puntacana07.blogspot.com OR www(dot)puntacana07(dot)blogspot(dot)com so check them out. (Of course you'll need to type the dot and not the word itself... I don't think Trip Advisor allows you to link to other sites from the reviews.) If you choose Excellence Punta Cana, you're guaranteed the trip of a lifetime. I didn't want to come home!
