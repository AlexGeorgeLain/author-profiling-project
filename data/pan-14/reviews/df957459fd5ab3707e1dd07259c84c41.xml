Clean rooms, a bit musty but very nice. Food was decent if a bit salty. Staff amazingly pleasant as were the locals. None of that you hijacked our paradise vibe one gets in Hawaii for example. Makeup of guests seems to be about 3/4's Russians, a lot of Australians/NZ and Brits and a few Americans. I was travelling alone to Bali after finishing some work in Jakarta and this place makes one painfully aware of ones solo status as everyone else seems to be paired up. So I would call this an ideal place for a couple or honeymoon or to jump start the passion. Also took a great tour from Tours East to see the Monkey Forest etc and it involved a minimal amount of running the vendor gauntlet as I call it and our guide was very informative and pleasant (even after it was clear i wasnt here to buy anything).
