Having read the reviews on here after booking we were a bit panicked and didn't know what to expect, but the hotel is great! We checked in at midnight on a Friday, the room was clean and quiet, the hotel location is ideal, and the staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is ok, had better, had worse. We booked through Hotel Connect, the whole system ran smoothly from start to finish and I'd recommend them too. We paid about for 3 nights, bargain.
