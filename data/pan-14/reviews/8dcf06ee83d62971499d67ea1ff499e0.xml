We stayed at the Travelodge Wynyard for 8 nights.Really is a 'value for money' hotel.The location is so perfect ,being 10 minutes from Darling Harbour, 15 from The Rocks and 10 minutes from Chinatown. As its practically next door to Wynyard Station. Which you can use from the Airport and Back. If you buy a sydney travel pass this train fare is included. The pass doesn't start until you use it within sydney town centre (so think about how many days you require)Hotel is off the same standard as our Travel Inns - so you know what to expect.There is a Coles Suppermarket located in Wynyard station for all your conveniences. If you need any advice whilst in sydney, then a visit to the sydney visitor centre in the rocks will sort you out.Have fun
