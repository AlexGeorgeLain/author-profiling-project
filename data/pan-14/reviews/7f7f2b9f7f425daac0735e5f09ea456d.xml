Very comfortable and beautifully maintained and decorated. The breakfasts were very good we had an inclusive rate which is a good idea as the restaruants are very expensive. We only tried the one Balanese restaruant in the hotel and it was good with a lovely atomsphere!The hotel is situated an a lovely beach and one can walk to seadfood restaurants further along the beach in the evening for grilled fish.I highly recommend this hotel for a very romantic holiday.Anne MatthewsCapeTown
