Perfect venue if you only have a few days to whizz round as its only 100 yards from Times Square.The staff very friendly and always ready to advise on how best to get around New York. We stayed in an upgraded club room which included a continental breakfast to set you up for the day. Only one restaurant within the Hotel and that's Shula's. Great steaks..a little pricey but you pay for what you get. The rooms were ok and we stayed on the 16th floor which still let some noise in, but this was only minimal.I'd certainly stay here again and the four stars is just about right.
