Lots of palm trees for shade and you can walk for miles. The Colonial buffet is really very good with a huge selection. All of the cold foods were kept on an iced surface and the hot foods constantly were replaced. The a la carte restaurants were not nearly as good as the buffet. We only went to them for a change and to be served. Beds and pillows are really too hard, as the other reviews said.The room was very clean, despite the Mildew/Lysol smell that I always notice in the caribbean. We went on the outback safari tour to see more of the Dominican country side. It was very informative and lots of fun, but too many stops to buy trinkets (all owned by outback safari) and the included lunch was bland - not the spicey dominican food promised. Brush up on your spanish - english is not often spoken and americans were in the minority. Lots of Germans, French and Italians. Be prepared to see topless ladies at the beach. We took a walk up the beach to the flea market and had fun haggling for price. Thought we got a good price and them found the same things at the airport shops for about the same price!! Remember not to drink the tap water, and be warned that Montezumas revenge got me on the plane home and it can get you!! All in all a nice place with a beautiful beach.
