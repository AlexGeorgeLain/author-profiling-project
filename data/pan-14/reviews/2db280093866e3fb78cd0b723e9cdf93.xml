We reserved a deluxe room and after trying to enter the wrong room (front desk error), we finally entered our abode for the evening. Once inside, I wondered what a non-deluxe room must look like. There was nothing deluxe about the shoebox we checked into. It was very small, with a King size bed, a media armoire, a desk and a couple of chairs and lamps crammed into it. Pretty standard. Anyway, it would do. The problem occurred later when we came back from dinner past midnight and were looking forward to some serious shut eye. ALL NIGHT LONG there was this hideous creaking sound coming out of the ceiling. It was like living under a pacing 300 pound giant. I tossed. I turned. I turned on the TV to drown out the horrible noise. I piled pillows over my head. Finally, at 3:49 AM I gave up and just turned the lights on and started checking my e-mail. We ended up checking out at 9:00 AM so I could get home and take a nap instead of hanging out in the city for a few hours. There is nothing horribly bad about the Hyatt (except for that creaking) but there's nothing really great about it either. I'll definitely opt for other digs next time we visit.
