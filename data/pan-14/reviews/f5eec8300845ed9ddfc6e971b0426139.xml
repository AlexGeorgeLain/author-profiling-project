It is very clean, very modern, comfortable and large rooms. The staff is very helpful and nice! Plus the location can't be beat! It is the best location to be in... just steps from everything!Only two things I should mention .. it isn't really a hotel or inn in the normal sense .. it is more apartments. Which is fine, just please note that there isn't a typical front desk, etc. Also, we missed having the continental breakfast and it is hard to find a place for a sit down breakfast in the morning. However, we were only there for one night so if you are staying longer, it might not be an issue since they have a fridge, stove, etc in the room. Also, not all the rooms have the same amenities .. such as cable sattelite, etc. I think this would be the perfect place to stay if you are in Florence for 3 nights or so and are looking for less of a hotel type experience.
