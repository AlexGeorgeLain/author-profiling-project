When I drove up to this hotel it was excellent. There were 2 doormen just waiting to help you. The hotel has been renovated in the past 2 years and it was great. The staff very polite smiling and helpful.The lobby was comfortable Every evening, guests are welcome to the hosted evening Wine and Italian Beer reception from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m and always have Italian roast coffee, tea and biscotti in the lobby. Free high speed wireless Internet access, which in San Francisco most always has a charge. I will always come back to this hotel for business travel or for pleasure.I travel quite often and have stayed in many different hotels. Right now this hotel is at the top of my list. I will always tell everyone to try it.
