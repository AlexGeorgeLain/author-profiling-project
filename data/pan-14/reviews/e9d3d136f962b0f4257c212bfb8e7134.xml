Th breakfast was good, the maids did their job well, and it was very close (10mins walk away) from the train station (SMN) and 5 mins away from the Duomo. I went there with my boyfriend and although the atmosphere isn't romantic it was still very nice. it was well priced too. I was there over New Years Eve and the price literally doubled on the 31st and 1st for accomodation but that's to be expected everywhere. i would definitely recommend this hotel, and although the road it's in isn't exactly pretty there's a supermarket down the road and a square with trees and a merry - go - round right opposite, so when you're looking for it remember it's opposite Piazza Independenza.
