I crossed my fingers and wouldnt you know, it was fantastic.Flat screen, Wireless ( 10.00 bucks a day), Laundromat ( in the basement) excellent and friendly staff.. but the best...it was QUIET! Where else in New York can you get quiet? I stayed in downtown San Diego and didnt get a wink because of all the traffic and noise,,,but here on West 48 it was quiet as a mouse...except they are putting up a new high rise on the corner so if you sleep past 9am you are gonna get crane and concrete truck noise.We took Super Shuttle from JFK ( 38.00 for two people) however we took the subway and the Air Train back to JFK as by then I had figured out the subway and we got from hotel to our terminal in 50 min. When we arrived a week prior it took 2 hours for us to get to our hotel because you must call the super shuttle ( even if you have reserved it) and you must wait for it to come pick both you and others to drop them off at hotel. Never again will I take a super shuttle from jfk...I am a confirmed subway enthusiast now.
