For someone who conducted all business activities inside the Omni for the entire week, I never got cabin fever. There is plenty to do: outdoor pool, bar, nice restaurants, gym, free wifi. The concierge know plenty about great things to do around the area so they can direct you should you leave the hotel. The rate was 110/night. Rooms are clean, with beautiful comforters, Institute Swiss toiletry, and flat screen tv. I was so pleased with the Omni that I booked a business trip just so I can stay at this place again.
