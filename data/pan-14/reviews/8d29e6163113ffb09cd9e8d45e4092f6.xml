I had a king size room on the 12th floor. The bed was amazingly comfortable with lots of pillows and a douvet. I liked the big walk-in shower, glsss doors, seat in the shower. This is not the postage stamp size bathroom in most NYC hotel rooms. The complimentary shoe shine service was professional. The room was very clean and comfortable, large plasma screen TV, and we had a great view from the window. Yje lobbies are funky and tasteful. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay.

Each has a fridge and counter space. The commplimentary breakfast was excellent (eggs, ham, juice, coffee, toast). The front desk help were superb: friendly, efficient - the best. The bus stop for the 25 cent bus ride to old San Juan is one block away. The rooftop sun deck offers great views of the ocean and San Juan. The neighborhood is what I would call faded grandeur. It looks like it is trying to make a comeback.My only complaint is that it is not blocks to the ocean. Well, maybe it is, but you CANNOT walk there. The hotel is surrounded by highways.Not, it's not the Intercontinental, but for the price and the location, it's excellent.
