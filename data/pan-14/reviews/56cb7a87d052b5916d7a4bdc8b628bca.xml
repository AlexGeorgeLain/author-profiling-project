I booked ages ago and specified a two bedroom apartment - non smoking. We also requested that the sofa bed be made up. I think that our apartment was a smoking one as there were very strong smells of cigarettes!!!Apartment was very small indeed - sofa bed was not made up till 11.30 that night - after three requests.Our apartment was on the first level - bedroom on Abercrombie Lane - this was a very noisy room plus curtains do not close properly so light comes in - had to sleep with earplugs in!!!Our apartment looked like it needed a huge makeover - very tatty - in fact felt extremely disappointed and told them so when I filled out the guest feedback form and guess what have not heard from them - thought they might touch base to speak to me - but have heard not one thing.Great location but not value for money!!!Maggie
