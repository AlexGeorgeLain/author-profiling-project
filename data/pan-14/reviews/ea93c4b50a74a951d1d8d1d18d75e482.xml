Terrible Location, Front desk staff had a terrible attitude. The room was adequate, boring and the hotel had no personality. It was nothing more than a place to sleep in a great city. We were charged automatically for breakfast everyday and had to ask each day for the charges to be removed from our bill. Personally I think that's a little unscrupulous, we were also charged everytime we touched something in the mini-bar. I didn't say consumed, I said touched. Little insignificant annoying petty practices by the management make this hotel a place that I will NEVER visit again. If Priceline sticks you there, check your bill..

Near the UN, so it has a very international clientele. We would stay there again on our next visit to NY.
