The neighborhood is edgy and there is a great bagel place around the corner. If your interested in shopping in Cow Hollow or Japan town this is a great place, otherwise transportation is a bit difficult unless your interested in riding the cable car everywhere which is pricey at $5 each way.

Location is the real wildcard. If your in the city to do the tourist thing and love the Warf this would be a great place to be and has easy access to the neighborhoods tourist venture to most (North Beach, China Town, etc). The downtown neighborhood have much going on unless into clubbing but all areas of town are super easy to get to by bus from this hotel. Place like Hayes Valley, Noe Valley, Castro, and the Mission are much easier to get to then the Warf, plus super easy to get to the Warf, North beach, and Chinatown, plus downtown is cheaper all the weekends I have checked.
