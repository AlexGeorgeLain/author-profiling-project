However via hotel.club.net we managed to book a double at the Hotel Principal for 204 euro's including breakfast and I have been pleasantly surprised about the quality of the hotel. For 204 euro's I have been in worse hotels. Some hotel in Paris, the name eludes me,charged 350 for a two days stay.The location of the Hotel is great. Situated just of the Rambla in a nice and quiet street within walking distance of the plaza Catalunya, Gothic Neighborhood and of course la Rambla. The staff were really friendly and had great suggestions about things to do and to see and because we caught a really early flight we were at the check in at the hotel at 9 o clock and they already let us check in, which was great so we could take a shower and do a quick nap.I am not that fussy about the type of room I stay in size wise but it has to be clean and especially the bathroom. The hotelroom was not that big, but it was nice and clean with , laminated floors? I am not that big a fan of carpet on the floors as rooms with carpet do tend to get a bit musty. The bathroom was really spacious and though it did not have bath, had wonderful shower and it was nice and clean. ( People who have lived in student houses probably can appreciate a nice a shower) The only minus point which I can think of is the fact that on the first day we did not have enough towels only two small ones.But he I guess we could have asked for some more.In summary I would definately recommend this hotel for everybody
