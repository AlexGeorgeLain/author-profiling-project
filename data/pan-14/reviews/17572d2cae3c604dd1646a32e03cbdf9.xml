I booked through the hotel website early and had a rate of $160 sgd/night which was a great value for this caliber of hotel. The room was spacious, clean, the bathroom was excellent. Only problem was they did not have my reservation when I arrived, but the problem was resolved. The subway is very close to the hotel, you can walk directly from the hotel into the mall and into the subway without going outside. The walk to the subway is less than 5 minutes.

Bathroom was very clean. Hotel is connected to a very large mall. Booked the room early on the hotel's website and saved 10%. We had the deluxe room for 1 week and the executive room upgrade for one day. The only difference is a separate shower stall in the executive and slightly larger room. Concierge was very helpful with recommendations for food. We took the hotel shuttle bus which was 130 hkd which worked out well. Would stay here again if ever in HK again.
