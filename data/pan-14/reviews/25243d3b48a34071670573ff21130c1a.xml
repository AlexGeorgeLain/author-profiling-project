Our room was No. 32 in the Annex and it was sparkling and brand new. Walter mentioned that it wasn't quite complete as they would be adding pictures to the walls, etc. We loved it just the way it was. Our room had a separate sitting area and both rooms had exquisite murano glass chandeliers and large wood beams. The walls were covered in a soothing green brocade fabric. Wow. The bathroom was also very beautiful and spotless. We waited about 1/2 hour for our room to be ready because they had just that day turned on the new A/C for the season and the one in the sitting room was dripping from its 15 foot ceiling. Walter made sure we both had a glass of vino while we waited. That 1st night, the A/C leaked again and when we told Sondro the next morning he was all apologies. We told him no apology needed. We were more concerned with the dripping water ruining that beautiful floor and the ceiling below our room than anything else! Needless to say, while we were exploring Venice that morning, the A/C was fixed. Our room had a small balcony that could be reached by small french doors from the sitting room area. All of our windows faced the small calle. As I said in my title, Don't tell anyone about this hidden gem! Thanks again Walter, Sondro and your lovely staff.
