I had also stayed several times in this hotel when it was known as the Corus. Even though the Corus was ok, it is nice to see it being renovated.We had a nice size renovated room, no problems. On Check in they did not have our booking and I think they tried to sort it out with the agent over the phoe, after about 15 mins we were in our room. Although our booking was room only, when i enquired about the cost of breakfast next morning, the desk advised it was included in our room charge, so that was a bonus. Breakkie was nice.All in all, I'm glad we chose this hotel.
