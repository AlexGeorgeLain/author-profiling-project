I would never have found this delightful hotel without you. We stayed two nights at the beginning of October and I wish we could have stayed longer. As others have said, it is in a perfect location, quiet, clean, comfortable bed, good food, friendly and helpful staff. I was very pleased with the Duc de la Victoria.
