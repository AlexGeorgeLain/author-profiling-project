To summarize our experience with the Elysees Regencia: it is a very fine hotel.Some pro's:* nice staff, that will help you with booking restaurants* good location (close to the Champs Elysees, subway station nearby (George V))* nice, clean and quite spacious (for Paris!) room. Nice touch: during the day the room is organized (with the green pillows)differently than in the evening (set up for bedtime, with a chocolate and refreshing towel on your pillow). Bathroom (marbled) is ok, with bathrobes slippers and l'Occitane tolietry. The bath itself is a bit on the small side though (no problem for us, though)* a very good feature is the separate toilet from the bath* on arrival, we received a Paris tourist guide and a map (we didn't need it though, since we brought our own and we do know Paris a bitA con* you do hear a bit of street noise (traffic noise from the Avenue Marceau), though it didn't bother us reallySince we woke up quite late, we cannot say how breakfast was (breakfast being served til 1030 am).We would definitely return here.
