Room 416 which we were assigned was a very pleasant surprise. We did not expect a suite with two televisions. Everything was impeccable, the staff helpful and courteous. We checked in on Oct. 20 thru 23, and the details were those we expect from the high end hotels. A newspaper at the door on weekdays, shower heads with several options, the huge array of choices at complimentary breakfast. I had expected something akin to a Continental breakfast. I was blown away by the breakfast choices and small details like a cherry on the plate when the omlette was returned by the cook. The hotel is in an enclave so we walked out to the main street, Ave Isla Verde, and right across the street was the A5 bus to Old San Juan. We still patronized the casino at the El San Juan which is 5 mins away because it is bigger than the casino at the Embassy. My husband said it best, on a scale of 1 to 5, I give them a 10.
