The rooms, however, I found to be really dissapointing. The first room I checked into, 212, I think, was tiny and very dirty. The floorboards looked like they had water damage - they were moldy and peeling. The bed linens looked really old and shabby, the shower head in the shower was at my collar bone - I am 5'6 - I had to bend down to shower. It was also EXTREMELY loud. I requested a room change, which I got the next day, and this room was much quieter, but still felt dingy and unclean. This room was even smaller (this was room 316) and had only a shower, no tub. The shower was really really small. I weigh 130 and I could barely turn around in it without toughing a (plastic) wall. The door didnt close properly, either. The worst part of this room was that it smelled really really bad. It was really offensive every time I entered the room, and I felt generally grossed out. The staff was OKAY - they didnt seem to care that I wasnt happy with my stay, and I was there three nights; but they werent outright rude by any means....not really that helpful though. good luck!
