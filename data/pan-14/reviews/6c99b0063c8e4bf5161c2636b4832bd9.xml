I have been priviledged, in that I have stayed at 3 other Ritz Carlton hotels before and they were all excellent. This one proved to be just as good.Front desk attention was brilliant, the room was very large with calssical design, all very new, superb details in the room, exceptionally comfortable bed, massive bath, lots of towels, brilliant toiletries (Bulgari), etc etc. Breakfast next day was very, very good - they had everything you could care to mention and MORE!Next time I'm in Berlin, this will AUTOMATICALLY be my choice.
