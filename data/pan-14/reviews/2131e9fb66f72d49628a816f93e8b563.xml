The place is a great location, walk down the hill to the Grauman Theater and the mall down the hill was even open on Xmas Day with lots of nice restaurants and shops. The staff was very very friendly. We had problems with the television and the engineer was there in about 5 minutes to fix it. The room was a little small for three of us (just two double beds and nothing else except a room with just a king size bed and we had our daughter with us). They made sure we got a book of discount coupons that saved us money in the mall and other places and were full of advice. It is good value for the location. It was a very pleasant experience.
