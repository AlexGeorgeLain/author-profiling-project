However, after spending a night there with my family I was quite please with the Hotel.We were after a very early check in on a Saturday morning and the staff did all they could to get our rooms ready. We finally got into out rooms about 12:30.Rooms were spacious and clean but I agree that the view from the window was non existent (not that it mattered to us). The shower was a little low on pressue but the bathroom was clean. We had two double beds (one extremely soft and one quite nice and firm) plus enough room for a cot that was supplied at no extra charge.Location is great. Walking distance to both Darling Harbour and Circular Quay/Rocks plus quite close the main shopping area.
