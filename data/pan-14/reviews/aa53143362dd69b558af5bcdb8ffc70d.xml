The location is perfect..just yards away from the Duke's statue and Waikiki beach. The rooms were fairly basic and needed redecorating but for the price what can you expect !! Recommended as a cheap option for Waikiki which can be expensive. Money saved on the hotel enabled us to do other amazing things in Hawaii.
