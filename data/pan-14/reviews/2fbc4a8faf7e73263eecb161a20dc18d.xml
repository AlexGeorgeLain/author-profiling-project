Just a five minute walk from the central station, tram stop just outside the front door. Easy to walk to all the major central amsterdam sites. 2) Its clean and comfortable. Cons: 1) No slippers and just one scratchy bathrobe in the room. 2) Crazy expensive for internet (it was 17 euros day?). Summary: Lots to do and see nearby. If you want to visit a coffeeshop I highly recommend Abraxis. It is like 1-2 blocks from the hotel. We did not try the restaurant - there were too many choices nearby.
