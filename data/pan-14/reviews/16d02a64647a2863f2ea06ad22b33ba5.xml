Perfectly located by Passeig de Gracia train station ( 20mins direct from Barcelona Airport) we were warmly greeted by the front office staff especially Mar and Fernando.We were very happy with our room which over looked the street front. Whilst we didn't dine in the hotel, they happily helped us reserve a table at Shunka .Great location near shops and restaurants, would definately recommend Avenida for a weekend for weeks stay
