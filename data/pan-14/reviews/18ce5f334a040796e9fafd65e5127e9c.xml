This 16 story CondoHotel is sparkling clean, reasonably priced, and wonderfully staffed with helpful people. Rooms are good sized, attractive, well provisioned (many have full kitchens with glassware, cutlery, tableware, etc.), and have beautiful views.The Outrigger Luana Waikiki is located adjacent to the only large park left in Waikiki, and is within a short walking distance of the best shopping and famous Waikiki Beach.Definitely a little known gem in this ever expanding city. As my lovely wife says, This is the only way to visit Waikiki!
