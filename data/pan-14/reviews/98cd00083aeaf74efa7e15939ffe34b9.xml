The room was nothing special (the worst I've been), small, old and the heater has been grabbed from the wall and there was dust in. The bathroom was much better and clean. Our friends had to change their room because the 1st one had a really strange smell and was dirty.The staff was really bad, un-helpful and, at breakfast, they were always looking at us as if we were going to steal food or something. They didn't offer to help with the luggage and gave us rooms located somewhere strange with no indications and, when we asked for help to find the rooms they were unpleasant.The breakfast was really good and with a wide choice and the comedor was new and with very good conditions.The hotel is far away from the heart of Barcelona, at night that zone is quite scary, all the shops are closed and with metal doors, so it is not very pleasant to walk there at night. The nearest Metro station os Clot, 5-10 minutes walking. The metro station was dirty and had no one at night.I think now the hotel is renovated but if I return to Barcelona I would not choose Catalonia Aragon!
