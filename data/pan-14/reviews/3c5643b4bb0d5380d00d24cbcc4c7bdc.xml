The decor of the room was however on the 70sor 80s era. But its does look nostalgic. The pillows are not fluffy but is didn really bother me. Nice simple hotel.

The hotel is about 5 mins walk from the train station. Good location if you are travelling by train to your next destination. The cafe has a nice train theme. The breakfast fair was just average..nothing to fancy. I booked a triple room, the size of the room was small and the bathroom did not have a shower curtain so after a shower the entire bathroom will be wet. Overall, had a good experience.The rooms were clean and the receptionist was friendly. Would recommend it to traveller who won't be spending too much time in the room.
