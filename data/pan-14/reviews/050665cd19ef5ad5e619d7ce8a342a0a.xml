This is my favorite place to stay in Hawaii because it is so beautiful and unique from all the other hotels. All of the rooms are gorgeous- even coming from someone who had a non-ocean view room half of the time! The hotel is just the right size- they have some cute boutiques, beauty services, and amazing restaurants. They offer shuttles to many of the nearby attractions and their service is always so efficient. I love the Royal Hawaiian and would never stay anywhere else on my vacations in Oahu!
