Of note is the addition of free internet in the hotel and a computer in the lobby for guest use. In addition to the regular continental breakfast there is simple breakfast (juice, coffee, croissant)for 6 euros and you can order cereal, eggs, etc for a moderate supplement. The staff is very competent and helpful. The only negative was the standard double did not have any drawers for organizing personal items.
