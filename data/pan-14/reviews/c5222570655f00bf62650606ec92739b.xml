Our initial concerns were that the hotel appeared to be miles from anywhere and also at the intersection of several large highways. However, it is situated near local bus stops and we found we could travel around Los Angeles and down to Santa Monica and Venice with no difficulty. Both the hotel valet staff and local bus drivers are extremely helpful-more so than the taxi drivers! The hotel has everything needed and the rooms were very comfortable. There was little noise inside the room despite being surrounded by many lanes of busy roads. I would highly recommend this hotel for a short break in Los Angeles.

We stayed here over New Year and were a little unsure of what to expect due to the diversity of reviews on this site. However,we were very pleasantly surprisd at the standard of the hotel. Very convenient for all the attractions, only a short walk from Times Square and a few minutes from Central Park. Our room was large, with a HUGE bed, well decorated, a wide screen TV, tea and coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, room safe etc. The complimentary breakfast was very enjoyable and you could eat loads of fruit, cereals, hot dishes etc. There was also free packed breakfasts for those in a rush and free tea, coffee, hot chocolate, cookies and fruit all day long in the foyer. The hotel was very clean and all the staff friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for accomodation in the heart of the city.
