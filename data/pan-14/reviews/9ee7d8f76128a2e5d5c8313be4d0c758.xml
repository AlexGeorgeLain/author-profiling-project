Having been open for only six months this hotel looks and feels in pristine condition and the staff seem genuinely pleased to welcome guest. Henri greeted us at lunchtime and took us personally along the street to their favourite restaurant (Wadja) and checked that they had a table available. The set meal (3 courses) was superb and very good value at per person. What is more, there was a problem with the credit card machine and, unbeknown to us, the bill for our meal was charged twice. At breakfast the next morning, Henri explained that the proprietor of the restaurant had been in to the hotel to explain and apologise for the error. We resolved the problem by going back there on our last day and having lunch again!Our Club room (11) at the hotel was very well equipped and as small as we expected. The bathroom was fine, except that they have a problem at the moment with the glass panels attached to the baths which are supposed to allow you to shower. There is no rubber strip at the bottom and therefore no seal between shower panel and the bath - result - lots of water on the floor when you step out of the shower! The hotel is aware of the problem - but might have warned us in advance.Continental Breakfast was ample and beautifully presented.Not the cheapest hotel in Paris, but well worth the money.
