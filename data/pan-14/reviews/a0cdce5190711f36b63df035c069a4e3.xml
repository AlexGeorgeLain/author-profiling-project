Our king bed room was of good size, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The staff were all eager to assist and a refreshing change to some other large city hotels at which we've stayed. One item I should mention; there is no safe in the room. Valuables have to be stored in safe boxes located with the concierge. This is not a problem except for the fact that boxes are limited in size and number. We had a great stay and can recommend this hotel to visitors wanting to see Historic Boston and the walk the Freedom Trail.

The Art Deco styling is quaint but tired and the place could do with the benefit of an extensive face lift. That said, we had a executive king suite which was clean and spacious and on the whole very comfortable but some of the more public areas are not so appealing and definitely not as described on the hotels web site.
