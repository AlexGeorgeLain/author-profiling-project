In short: a very good location but a very low average level of the hotel's guests, no controls and no appropriate interventions from hotel's officers and a very bad service/price ratio. A few examples.At the swimming pool, pool attendants, except those who hand over the towels but don't make anything else (I have unsuccessfully asked to be helped on with the placing of an umbrella ),are nonexistent; still at the pool, where chairs are extremely close each other, one day ny four neighbours had lunch with cans and foods picked up at a nearby supermarket, thus disseminating all around stinks and garbage, but evidently the hotel management allows it; inside there is one bar only, unbelievably noisy due to the music always kept at full volume,but with no alternatives; the waitresses of the bar are very uncultured and one of them didn't know the existence of something called sherry; many of the hotel's guests wear baseball caps and Stetson in the evening even in the bar and the restaurants and have a behaviour which would be very indulgent to define as coarse; the hotel's shop has only a couple of local and of American newspapers, and that's all;etc.Obviously my complaints would be of little importance, if any, should I refer to a third class hotel, but I am talking about an Intercontinental with room rates justifiable only for a high class hotel.In conclusion, the excellent location of the Intercontinental in Portorico, just on the beach and very close to the airport, is surely a positive aspect but absolutely insufficient to compensate all the negative ones ( and I have mentioned only a few of them ).
