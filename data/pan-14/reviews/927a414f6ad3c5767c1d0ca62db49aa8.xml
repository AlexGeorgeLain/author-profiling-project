The hotel was very quiet, no late night noise.The staff were tremendously helpful, couldnt do enough for you.Above all else the location is excellent. there was a stike on that affected the buses the underground, not a problem when staying in the Hilton as all the major sites are within walking distance. Also very handy for great resturants. Would stay here again.
