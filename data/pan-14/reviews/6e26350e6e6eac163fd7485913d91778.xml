Minor problems will always happen but you have to look beyond this, Many choices of where to eat and find your fancy. Liquor was fine and if you found too weak, ask for a shot on top. I did not mind tipping because if I find service good this is not a problem for me. Alot of the Super Clubs I have been too have become quite lax in there service and places like Secrets I feel will take over in the place to go. Over all beauty of this resort is well worth the visit. I stayed at Bldg 1 the swim out suites by the cascading waterfall. Great Desk people, Friendly people, Great Resort and I am planning to return next year. I went boogie boarding and I had a great time. The layout of the pools throughout this complex is beyond anything I have seen at any other resort.Like I said I heve been there and done that at many resorts and would like to share my visit with anyone who would like too know more. Me and my wife are in our early 50.s and we travel with her sister and her husband every year. We were there April 5th to the 12th.
