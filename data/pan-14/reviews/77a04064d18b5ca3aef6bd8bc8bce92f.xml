The breakfast was very good and we got a deal where it was included in the room rate.Following advice from other reviewers, we asked for a room with a balcony on the fifth floor. Our friends did not and although their room was also on the fifth floor and was comparable to ours, we had the better view.Without exception the staff were helpful and friendly. They spoke excellent English and nothing was too much trouble. Fabienne is exactly as described by other reviewers - cheerful and welcoming.We will definitely stay here again on future trips to Paris and highly recommend it.
