As a Diamond HH member, I stay in Homewoods quite a bit and this one is the best I have ever stayed in.The rooms are nice (if you can grab one at the end of the hall they have a half circle design in the front with plenty of windows and potential bay views out the front and Space Needle views out the bedroom) and this place has the best morning breakfast and evening meal of any Homewood I have stayed at.The offer parking (never charged myself for parking on 2 stays) and it is a very easy walk to the Space Needle complex and to the waterfront. They were also offering a shuttle to both cruise ship piers.Great place, looking forward to my next stay there.Chris
