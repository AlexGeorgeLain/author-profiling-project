They gave us two adjacent rooms on the top (3rd) floor, however there was no door between the rooms unlike in many other hotels.Many positives:* Convenient location.* Friendly and helpful staff (who also made museum reservations for us).* Clean and comfortable rooms/bathrooms; not noisy at all.* Moderately priced for such a popular tourist destination.Some (minor) negatives:* The elevator broke down on our first day, and was not repaired even by day 4.* WIFI access is only in the lobby, and did not always work. No internet in the rooms.Overall would recommend it for people looking for a comfortable, pleasant but certainly not luxurious stay at a moderate price.
