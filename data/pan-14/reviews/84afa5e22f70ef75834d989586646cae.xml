I arrived at the hotel at about 21:30 at night. Staff at the front desk had very great smiles. Service was excellent; staff were all very friendly. Check-in time only took 2 minutes. The room was spacious and very cozy. Everything was well-equipped. With DVD player and LCD TV. However the broadband charge was just too expensive it cost RMB$160/hour!Food outlets provide very fine dining but it was costly. Food in the mid-town was much cheap than that.The swimming pool in the hotel was closed for maintance during my stay. I was firstly very diappointed with this. However at the last day of my stay, I went to the Spa and looked whether the maintance of the pool was over, but it was still under process. The receptionist of the Spa saw me and tell me she can arrange that we can swim in the Westin Hotel which was just nearby. It was a surprise. When I changed my clothes at my room, she called me and told me that the hotel's car was prepared. A free private car tranfer was arrange. I didn't expected this. This was very impressed.Also, I'd contacted the concige to book me a taxi for going to the great-wall and it just cost $800. When I step out the hotel, I found they'd booked me a very comfortable private car. This was valuable because it was same price if I booked a Taxi myself.This hotel is just too great. The room is the most spacious one. The service is excellent. Staff with great smiles and very friendly. This is really 6-star hotel in Beijing
