This was a surprise bday gift from Hubby...Although we only stayed for 5 days 4 nights, I must say this was a fantastic getaway from (baby furbaby)! :)From the minute we landed to the day we left, everything was simply perfect and smooth!The entire grounds were breathtakingly beautiful, the staff was extremely friendly, the entertainment was uplifting, the food was plentiful delish and most importantly, the weather was perfect!Hubby and I spent most of our days working on our tans and relaxing by the beach..Okay, also the bar (which was a swim-up).It was nice to see that it was very family friendly-but certainly not like Disneyland...The kids were well behaved and there was plenty of space to keep to themselves. It was our first time at an all inclusive vaca and I dont know if I'll ever do otherwise! :) This is definately one we'll be coming back to!!
