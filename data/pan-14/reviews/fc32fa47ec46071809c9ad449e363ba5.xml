The hotel has one of the best overal in Barcelona, within a few yards to the underground, five minutes walk to Las Ramblas and five minutes walk to the beautiful modern port area where there are endless walks and pleasure boat trips available.We were going on a cruise and needed a taxi to get to the cruise port (12 - 20 euro, depending on the driver).The trip in from the airport cost just over 30 Euros and takes about 20 minutes depending on traffic although evening rush hours can take over an hour easily.The hotel staff were excellent and they offer free WiFi access or broadband using their own business centre if you do not carry your own laptop.The breakfast buffet in the hotel is a bit limited but if you purchase breakfasts for the full duration of your stay it will only cost 9.50 Euro and is very reasonable as the food is of good quality although the hot items are a bit limited. Or if you prefer there are plenty of restaurants and bakeries within a few minutes walk.
