Staff were unfailingly helpful even locating a dinner reservation for New Year's Eve which I appreciate is not an easy thing to arrange. We loved the location so very central. rooms clean and well maintained, the shower was an over bath affair but powerful nonethelss.Breakfast was marvellous. The bar staff on the 5th floor were so welcoming and hospitable even went to the trouble of locating the word in a dictionary for us as we striggled with an italian newspaper! We would have loved a river view but I suppose one can't have it all!
