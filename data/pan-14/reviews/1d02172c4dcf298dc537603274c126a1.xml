We recently spent 4 days (a precruise stay in Barcelona) at this wonderful funky hotel after reading the great reviews on Trip Advisor and finding almost all comments to be true. I cannot thank David Iturbi (at the Front Desk) enough for all the help he gave us. First, he recommended the Romantic Package which was a much better deal than the original regular room booking we had made online. It came with a complementary hearty buffet breakfast every morning, a bottle of Cava and Chocolates in our room , a delightful dinner around the corner at Iurantia with Wine AND an upgrade to a beautiful Terrace Room. David also helped us with making reservations for 18 of our fellow Cruise Critic folks who met for a precruise dinner the night before we sailed at a great local (non-touristy) restaurant, the Taverna cam Margarit. Would have been hard for us to do from the US since they didn't open until 9pm Barcelona time and didn't speak much English. All in all, a great time was had by all.We found all of the Front Desk staff to be most helpful with suggestions and directions. Hotel Soho cannot be beat for value and great ambience. WE WOULD DEFINITELY STAY THERE AGAIN!!!!
