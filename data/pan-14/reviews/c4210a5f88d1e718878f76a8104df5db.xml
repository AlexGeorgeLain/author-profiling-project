Planning second trip already and will definately be returning to this hotel. Highly recommend room 1909 completely refurbished, only downside faces Fairway market which can be quite noisy during the early hours when deliveries are being made, not good if your a light sleeper like me. We did tried Vinnies pizzeria as recommended on tripadvisor, never go there again worst pizza I have ever had. Plenty of other great restuarants to choose from and your never faraway from Starbucks which is always good news. We were there for the St Patricks day parade which was fantastic. Next trip planned for fall to see Central Park in all its glory. This hotel is so close to Central Park that we walked through it everyday, its amazing.
