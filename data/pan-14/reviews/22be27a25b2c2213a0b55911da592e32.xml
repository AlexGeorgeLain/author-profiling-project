The staff is friendly and the location great. Note it's a long way from union square and fishermans wharf, but as long as you are aware of that it doesn't matter. One suggestion though if you want to blow the budget on a fantastic meal it's just down the road from Boulevard restaurant which is one of SF's finest. The only complaint I'd have is that the rooms are small, it is hard to get around that but if you pay more money they do have larger rooms with harbour views but I only saw those when I walked down the hall.
