Kurfurstendamm is a main shopping street and has many shops and restaurants in the vicinity. There is a subway station about 150 metres away and the S bahn station Savigny is about 500 m away. These allow for easy travel to all of Berlin`s sights. The hotel has a nice breakfast room on the top floor, which can get crowded, but the breakfast is excellent. Rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable and the staff are generally friendly and helpful. This hotel is great value, I would definately stay there again
