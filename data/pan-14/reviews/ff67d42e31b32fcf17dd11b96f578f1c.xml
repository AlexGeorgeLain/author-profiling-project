The hotel is very easy to find from either the bus or railway station. We had room 220 although the higher ones may have a view, you do pay for it we were not really bothered by street noise. The public areas are georgous with high ceilings, frescos, the whole works. Make sure you find the roof terrace on the sixth floor, as the others say, the views are to die for. Our room was decorated very nicely, with watered silk on three walls, a fresco painted on the bare wall above the bed. Speaking of which the bed must have been eight feet wide at least. The furniture was a little battered, but i got the impression this may have been deliberate, to add to the whole impression of faded elegance. The bathroom was quite large with a shower over a bath tub a huge mirror over the basin. You are provided with bath robes every night a mat slippers are laid out by your bed. We stayed on a room only basis so i can not comment on the breakfast, but it was offered to us at the cost of 22 euros each per day, needless to say we did not accept went to the local bars where i would say we paid about 10 euros each day. Make sure you visit the covered market just round the corner from St. Lorenzo, food heaven!
