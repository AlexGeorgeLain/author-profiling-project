Not in service, not it ammenities or facility.The bed was comfortable, there is a bose wave radio in the room, but other than that, nothing else was out of the ordinary. Be prepared to pay extra for anything else. THere is wirless internet in the room, but pay extra 20 euros a day or 5 euros for an hour. There is room service, but you have to pay extra for it. Briging ice to the room is considered room service if you want to buy anything from the minibar. The location is very nice though. Away from the noise and very safe and clean area of the city and at a walking distance to all the important sites.
