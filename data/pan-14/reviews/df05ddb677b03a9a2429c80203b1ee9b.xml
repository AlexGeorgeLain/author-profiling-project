The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the train station (which feels longer with luggage) and an easy walk to the Cathedral and all the other sites of Florence (the historic centre is pretty compact). For 65 euro we got a good sized room with a private bathroom (down the hallway) which seemed pretty good for Florence. The staff were generally helpful though the women at the desk seemed unwilling to book Uffizi tickets for us (maybe her English wasn't as good as some of the other staff). Also has (slow) internet access for free. The hotle is a short walk from restaurants and cafes - we ate breakfast each morning at a cafe down the street for less than 3 euros.Would definately stay here again.
