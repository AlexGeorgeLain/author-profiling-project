Enough space, super comfortable beds and linen, good TV service, free fast internet connection, bathroom that you want to copy for your own home and room service that is actually worth the money.Then there's the free health spa down on the 1st floor, complete with pool, sauna, steamroom, relaxation room, different types of showers, ice for body scrubbing, and massages available for reasonable rates.I know I sound like I work for the company, but this is my second time staying here, and think it's one of the best designed contemporary hotels in the region, perfect for a few nights business trip.Highly recommended.
