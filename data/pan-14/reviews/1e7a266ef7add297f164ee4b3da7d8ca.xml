As a business hotel, it has issues. If you find issues, be prepared to ask twice to get them fixed.On my first night, my air conditioner didn't cool the room enough. In the morning, I asked to have it fixed. That day, it wasn't fixed (they went home early today). That evening I tried three other rooms until I found one with a fully functional A/C.There are no coffee pots in the rooms (so you'll buy coffee in the restaurant). I said I want a coffee pot, since I leave for business in the morning before the restaurant opens. It didn't arrive after the first day, so I insisted and it arrived for the third day.They send out laundry (a real feature), but only if you insist (why wasn't laundry picked up today? I don't know, we'll send it out tomorrow). Evidently, laid-back vacation spots are not high-performing business hotels.
