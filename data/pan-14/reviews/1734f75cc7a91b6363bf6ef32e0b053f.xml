I got a really good deal on it (about per night), I was a bit worried about the quality of the hotel, but it was the only decent one available. I was 100% pleased with this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and decorated very neutrally, really nice and relaxing. I booked a twin room with 2 queen sized beds. Staff are really nice, very willing to help. The hotel is on California street, only 10ish minute walk to union square and only a couple of blocks away from China Town. The Tram line runs directly out the front of the building so you can hop on and go to Fisherman's Wharf. Every evening when we returned to the hotel, room service turned down our beds, put relaxing music on the television and put a little Chocolate on our pillows that said each day must end with a reward (something along those lines). I have had a better stay in San Francisco and I recommend this hotel enough. I stayed in the Marriott for a few nights and the Omni beats it hands down.
