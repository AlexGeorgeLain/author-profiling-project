We found the hotel to be stylish and whilst the rooms are not the largest we have seen they are clean, comfortable and well appointed particularly useful was the free 'always on' cable Internet access in the room. The staff were friendly and helpful and it was enjoyable sitting in the bar listening to the jazz trio of an evening. We also found the location of the hotel very useful. If arriving on the Narita Express, it is only a 1440 Yen taxi ride away from the Tokyo Station and the train links near the hotel make it very easy to get around. There are also shops nearby from a local convenience store in the basement to bars and restaurants in the Pedi Shiodome complex which is linked to the hotel by a walkway. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay there and would be happy to go back and recommend the hotel to anyone going to Tokyo.
