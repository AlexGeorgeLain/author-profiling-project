Her son luciano was also nice and helpful. We feel us like at home. The hotel is in the centre of firenze. Very close to restaurants, city center and nice stores. (Prada is across the street, cartier is under the hotel, all famous brands are in the same street) I ll definitely stay in this hotel in my next trip.
