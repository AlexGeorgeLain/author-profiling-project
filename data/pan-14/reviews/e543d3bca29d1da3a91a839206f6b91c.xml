We were given a large double room - parquet flooring, wooden furniture and a view of the street outside. Beware the shower in the bathroom, as the curtain that surround it is not long enough to stop the water flooding the floor so usually the floor is soaking wet!It does get cold at night - we went in Dec, so i used up all the blankets as the heating switches itself off at night.The breakfast was tasty - a buffet full of a selection of sweet pastries, breads, cereals etc.The hotel is within walking distance of everything but far enough not to be on the main drag.
