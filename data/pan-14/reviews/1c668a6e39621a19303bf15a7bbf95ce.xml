I stayed here in August 06 and this was probably the best value for money Hotel that stayed in, in Italy. The staff were extremely helpful, the location have been any better, you could see the Duomo from the bedroom window and could walk almost anywhere. The room was large, the shower / toilet was clean and adequate. The beds / towels are changed daily, the air-conditioning although slightly noisy did what it was meant to do and kept the room at the temperature at which it was set. The breakfast was ideal, with a never-ending supply of fresh orange, tea, coffee etc. The hotel is down a side street just off a busy main road but even with the windows open, you would have to struggle to hear any noise from it. The lift could take four people (of UK size). The computer in the reception area did have a slightly sticky keyboard, but hey for holiday use and free 24 / 7. I arrived by plane so I have any trouble parking. There is a good selection or / restaurants near by (although I would advise that you avoid the Fish Bar). I disagree with most of the other reviews. This is a good quality three-star hotel, which I would certainly return to.
