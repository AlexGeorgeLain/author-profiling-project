The restaurant was closed for renovation, which we did not know until checking in. This was a real disappointment and this meant there was also no room service. The hallway I was on had a strong incense-like smell that was not pleasant. It appears no one had cleaned under our beds in quite awhile: definite dust bunnies or something and an empty water bottle. I did like that you receive a free bottle of water upon check-in; it's a nice touch. Two windows in the room were already opened when we got up to the room so there just seems to be a lack of attention to detail in the housekeeping department. Parking prices were quite reasonable and the valet service was welcomed. There is a good little dessert spot down the street named David's.
