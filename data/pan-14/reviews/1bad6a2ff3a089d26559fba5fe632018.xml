We were at that resort from 8 to 15 of march, a groupe of 10 people and No WE WERE NOT VIP We had a wonderfull time. All the negative story will now stop it has to because everything is great. We did wait a little to go to the a la carte restaurent, but it' s not as bad as some people are saying. And they now have a live band at evening to keep us entertain until show time. A lot OF ENTERTAINEMENT DURING THE DAY, DANCING LESSONS AND ALL THAT, JUSTE LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE. All the chaires have arrived. And nobody has to get up early to reserve one because the guard wont let them so.... The food is excellent and beleive me we travel a lot, every years for the past 20 years and this resort is really it' s 4 1/2 stars it was given in first place. If you go already with anger, well...... it is you that will hate your vacation but go with an open mide and i am certain you will juste LOVE IT !! It is a fabulus place, verry beautiful place. Do I recomend this resort ? Of course !! Have a great vacation.
