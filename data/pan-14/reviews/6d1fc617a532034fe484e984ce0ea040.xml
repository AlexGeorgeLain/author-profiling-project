At $200 for a room, we had some high expectations. Since we've stayed at the Hotel Marlowe (an awesome experience) in Cambridge, most of the hotels in Boston just feel bland and average.Service: We found this to be a mixed bag. At check-in, our initial experience was just OK. We mentioned that it was our anniversary and requested a nice room. The clerk issued a mild shrug and then provided our keys. We were both dissapointed. The room was small, bland, and simply had a view of the nearby building. It was nothing special.However, after discussing the situation with the concierge, we were placed in a very comfortable mini suite with 2 rooms (bed room and 2nd room with couch and TV). We did not have a view of the water, but the room was comfortable and nice. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly.Location: We took a harbor cruise, so the location was excellent. The hotel is located next to the world trade center and across from the pier. There is also a MBTA stop adjacent to the hotel. The area feels very 'corporate' and not like traditional boston. Think conventions, office buildings, and a pier. It does have very easy access to I93, so getting into/out of the area is extremely easy.The hotel bar is nice and the interior is clean and fresh. The decoration is a bit bland and neutral.Without our requirement to walk to the harbor cruise, I'd rather stay at the Marlowe or try the Onyx.
