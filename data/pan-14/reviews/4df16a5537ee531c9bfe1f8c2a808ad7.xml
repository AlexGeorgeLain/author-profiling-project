We walked to 2 shows, a movie, shopping and restaurants. Convenient to Rockefeller Center, Fifth Ave. and theaters. Consierge was very helpful although overwhelmed at times. Beds comfy with down pillows. Was disappointed in restaurant- (Foleys). We had 1 dinner and 1 breakfast there. Both meals mediocre but very expensive. Lots of good restaurants within walking distaance so skip the hotel food but enjoy the convenience of the location
