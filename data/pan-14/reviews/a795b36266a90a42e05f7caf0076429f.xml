The rooms are magnificently decorated in a nautical theme, the lobby is very well done, and front desk staff, porters, doormen, everyone, extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the city and its surrounds.The wine reception was a nice touch, as were the two free internet terminals in the lobby area, and the attached Blue Mermaid restaurant on site was so good we ate there three nights in a row.For cheap breakfasts there's also a Starbucks out back.I've stayed in many great hotels around the world, but this is without a doubt my favourite. Only 1 gripe - leave the car at home or ensure your room rate includes parking - they charge $32 a day!A truly wonderful hotel.
