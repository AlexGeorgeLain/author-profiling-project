The staff was very nice, check in was a breeze. Since we hadn't had dinner yet, we asked if anything was open to serve at 9:30 p.m. Turns out there is a restaurant inside the hotel, called Roots, that was excellent!! The room was very comfortable. The bed just right and perfect for a good nights rest. The honor bar was affordable.The location was the best. The gates to China Town were right next door. We appreciate that the owner of the hotel made this a green hotel, specifically for guests with medical problems, using chemical free cleaning products. We loved this hotel and would definitely stay there again!
