We loved the location of it, right bang in the centre of Kowloon, and a two minute walk to the Star ferry.Our room was fine, large enough with two double beds, and really clean. We were initially offered an upgrade, but when the girl on the desk checked it out it was unavailable for the three nights, which was very disapointing. I think it is time for the hotel to modernise the bedrooms as when you arrive the reception is very grand which leads you to expect more from the rooms, but all in all we enjoyed our stay here and would return.
