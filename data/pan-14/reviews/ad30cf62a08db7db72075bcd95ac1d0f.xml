I was a little nervous about staying here initially, but Da House is a hidden gem in the heart of Old San Juan. I was completely surprised but how impressive this place was, expecially for the price! It was the cheapest place I could find, even in comparison to surrounding areas. It is a prefect example of Puerto Rican atmosphere, if you are looking to get away from the standard. Our room was clean and we loved the rooftop. Do not confuse this with a 5 star hotel- there is no elevator (but the stairs really arent bad at all) and there was no TV in our room, but if you want a cheap, clean and inexpensive stay with Puerto Rican flare, this is the place. The worst part truly is the noise, as there isnt much of a sound barrier between you and the partiers on the street below, but we didnt have any trouble sleeping. Great staff as well.In summary, terrific location, great price, very Puerto-Rico!
