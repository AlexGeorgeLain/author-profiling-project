This hotel is a basic 3-star hotel... not fancy or anything since it was built probably in the 60's but we didn't have any problems when we got there. We checked in early and our room was already available. We were on our honeymoon and left valuables in the room when we left so just left the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the room so we didn't have to worry about housekeeping or anything. This hotel is super close to shopping and Waikiki Beach is only a couple blocks away. Don't know if I would stay there again but for the price we got, it was a great deal!
