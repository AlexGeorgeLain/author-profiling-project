My husband and I are 49 and our two kids are aged 24 and 22. We all had a great time at the Ocean Blue and would definitely return again. The staff could not be more friendlier. The food was ok for what is was but remember you are not home.......The American Restaurant Route 66 and Mike Coffee House were the best. If you are going to the Ocean Blue IT'S A MUST TO GO TO MIKE'S. The rooms were kept very clean and whenever we asked for water or towels they were supplied very quickly. The staff conducted activites each and every day for both adults and kids but mostly geared to kids. They also performed by the pool each and every day. The ocean was gorgeous. Our main focus was relaxation and that's exactly what we did relax. The kids loved Victor the bartender......they miss you! We met many great people there. We will return to the Dominican however, as much as we loved the Ocean Blue we would like to go somewhere else for comparison.
