Our experience as always was enjoyable for my wife and I. The staff is professional, efficient and very helpful. They will help you where to go whether it is for a restaurant or day trips in Florence and beautiful Tuscany. Julia at the reception helped us solving problems with the car rental company when our car broke down. The hotel is situated in the heart of the historic area of Florence which would be handy and yet reasonably quiet . The rooms are beautifully appointed and amenities in the room are up-to-date. Vallet Parking is provided.We would certainly go back as we visit Florence frequently.
