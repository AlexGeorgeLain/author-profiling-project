Other reviewers here have already praised the hotel and we thoroughly agree. We'd like to add a little about practicalities.We arrived at El Prat and took the Aerobus into Barcelona at each. The buses run every 10 mins or so and you need the stop Place Catalunya. Then walk back along the Gran Via de la Cortes Catelan in the direction of Place d'Espanya and you will find the hotel on your right.We did not use the hotel bar or restaurant (other than breakfast - very good indeed), instead we took a bus (No 59 right outside the hotel) to the port where there is a huge selection of fresh fish restaurants - menu of the day starts at each. The last No 59 bus comes back at 22.30, or there is a night bus, N9. The single fare is but we bought a T-10 ticket from the machine just inside the underground at l'Universitat for which allows 10 trips and can be shared between 2 people over a number of days.The Place Catalunya is about 10 mins stroll from the hotel and has a very large, efficient tourist office (below ground but well sign posted). We bought a two day ticket for each on the Bus Touristic - these buses follow three different routes and you can hop on and off as much as you like over the two day period; there is also an audio facility in several languages.Others have commented that the hotel can be noisy - we had a room at the side and it was OK for us. The rooms are air conditioned and have a free safety deposit box and amini-fridge, which we used for our own water. The bed was very large and more comfortable than ours at home; the bathroom has a wet room - lovely. The rooms and public areas are very clean. The staff are very helpful, courteous and professional.
