Location was brilliant, close to all the major tourist attractions, although set in a quieter area. We had three rooms, on the 32nd and 35th floor, even had a view of the empire state building from one. All the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and a good size. A fridge was very handy when you have children with you. The maid service was excellent, clean towels daily, and plenty of, it was just a shame that there were no tea making facilities in the room, however there were free coffee and tea in the lobby every morning. All the staff were friendly especially sam (bar man). Overall a great place to stay,and would definately stay there again! P.S Pax next door was good for breakfast.as was Bullys round the corner 43rd st 3rd ave (i think) opposite fitzpatrick hotel!!
