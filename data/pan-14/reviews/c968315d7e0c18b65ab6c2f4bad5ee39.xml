The staff, especially the concierges, were very friendly and helpful.The food was good but dinner finished early and you couldn't even get a coffee in the bar after 10 p.m.It has no pretensions to be a grand or family holiday hotel but you couldn't beat it for ease of access to Darling harbour and the main shopping areas, including Chinatown. It wasn't even too far to walk to the parks and quays and, of course, Sydney Harbour bridge.Note, between midnight and 6 a.m. you need your room card/key to get in and operate the lift.
