Room was spacious furniture new, as hotel was opened only a year ago. The bathroom was vast, with marble everywhere, walk in shower, huge bath with a TV above. When we arrived at hotel, greeted by army of porters, who quickly unloaded our luggage, which was swiftly delivered to our room, while we checked in. Service was excellent, with staff eager to please.We did not breakfast at hotel, as quite pricey. However, we treated ourselves to afternoon tea in restaurant, which is highly recommended. Concierge services were good-they can recommend book local restaurants, trips etc. We took advantage of free transfer to airport check in facilities near to hotel. Recommend taking train to airport-fast clean much quicker cheaper than bus or private transfers. Only niggle was that our ironing (pressing) order was late in being delivered we had to phone for it. It was also expensive. No iron or board in room.
