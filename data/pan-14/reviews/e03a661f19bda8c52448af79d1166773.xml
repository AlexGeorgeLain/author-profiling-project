It is an older hotel in a so, so area but within one block of the free downtown busses (until 7pm) and our room was large, clean, and perfectly adequate. No WIFI but we picked up an unsecured line from nearby. Breakfast (extra) in the restaurant was quite good. Parking is extra but right there.We would not hesitate to stay there again.Our stay in this hotel was part of a 53 day US tour that took us over 10,000 miles, 36 different hotels, and a different restaurant every evening. We were on a budget so did not stay in luxury hotels or generally eat in expensive restaurants. This review is relative to what we found on average. We booked all hotels in advance over the internet, when available, and checked them all against reviews on TripAdvisor.com which we found very helpful.
