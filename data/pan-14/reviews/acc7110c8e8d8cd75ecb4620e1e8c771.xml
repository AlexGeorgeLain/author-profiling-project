Still, room was nice and cosy and the bed absolutely fab! Bathroom was also small, but again nice and clean. Free tea,coffee and hot chocolate with cakes in lobby! Location is central but nice and quiet! Overall we were very pleased with our stay.Tip - If you like tea/coffee in your room without going downstairs, get a travel kettle with you, very handy! We never travel without it:)
