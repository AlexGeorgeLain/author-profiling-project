This hotel is a little gem---rooms are compact but very stylish, with high-quality fabrics used in the draperies. Ample light and ventilation is provided by two large windows. Bathrooms are small but well-designed. Victor and Maria are delightful hosts, and it was a treat to be around their dog Othello in the breakfast room. I am remembering Victor's wonderful black currant jam, and wish I had brought a jar back home with me.I think the hotel is an excellent value and would definitely stay there again. The location, with proximity to the Rue Cler and Metro and bus stops, is unbeatable.

The hotel is extremely comfortable and cheerful, rooms are ample in size for two people, and the closet space is exceptional. I loved the bathroom with an actual shower door (important for Americans who are used to shower curtains/doors). One morning the light in the toilet room was burned out---we meant to tell the front desk but forgot. Nevertheless, the light was replaced by the time we returned to our room in the afternoon. Good attention to details here.We faced the street with two large windows, but we never heard any street noise unless we wanted to. Location cannot be beat---access to the Metro, Rue Cler, and city buses is very easy. The hotel is within walking distance of major sights, and there are many restaurants and cafes nearby. Frederique at the front desk was extremely helpful with making dinner reservations and calling cabs, and she did it all with a smile!
