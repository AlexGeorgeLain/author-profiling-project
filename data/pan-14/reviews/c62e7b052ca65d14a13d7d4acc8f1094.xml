When we arrived we were told we had been allocated a room on the 11th floor ,superior rooms,but after a short wait were told that we would be in a room on the executive 19th floor, including one free breakfast and one for 25% off.All for just under per night. Check in staff very helpful and friendly as were all staff.The room was bigger than any other Hong Kong hotel room that we had stayed in on 8 previous ocassions.Lovely views across to the Island and the harbour but dont expect a good view of the lights at night as the windows are tinted.Breakfast was very good with great views from the Promenade cafe..Transport was no problem, the star ferry took longer(12 mins) to Central but gave a great all round view of both sides.We had a good stay and can thoroughly recommend the Harbour Plaza.
