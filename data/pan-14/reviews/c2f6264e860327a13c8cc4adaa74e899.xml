I stayed in the hotel for 3 days and unfortunately landed there on the weekend of the Memorial Holiday which meant that we were unable to sample the restuarant as it was closed. We had no problems with the staff.Our room was lovely, but our bathroom was very much on the small size. There was no way you were getting two people in there at the same time and we are not big people.Apart from that I would recommend this hotel in the future.
