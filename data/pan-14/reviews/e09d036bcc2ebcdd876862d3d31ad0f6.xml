The resort was quite luxurious, quite beyond what our family is accustomed to. We had a balcony room overlooking the Caribbean. The children loved the pools and the grounds. The resort has its own island that you can go to (about a 10-min. boat ride), which really felt exotic. The worst problem at the hotel was that the food at the resort was not included, and everything was quite expensive. There was a Starbucks inside the resort which was the most reasonably priced place there. There were NO water fountains anywhere in sight, forcing us to buy water bottles at $7 each. If you are in Fajardo and want really exceptionally good Puerto Rican food, go to El Pasion del Fogon. It's down the road from the resort.
