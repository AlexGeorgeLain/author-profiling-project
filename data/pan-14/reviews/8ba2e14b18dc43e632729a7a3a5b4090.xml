It is currently being managed by the same staff that manages the Slovenian Tourist Office, which shares the hotel reception space. Although everyone is extremely kind and accommodating, there are obvious flaws in this arrangement and the hotel gives the impression of being almost more like a rooming house than what is billed as a three star hotel. Small hotels are our preference and we seek them out but this one frankly disappointed us. The quaint canal house atmosphere includes a VERY steep climb up either 1, 2 or 3 floors depending on your room and is absolutely not suitable for folks who are unable to manage stairs with agility. The staff does handle the luggage, which is helpful. The rooms are average, at best, and starting to show signs of wear. The price is certainly right at this time of year but their summer rates may be too high for the quality of the experience.
