We changed to one that had a very nice Diamond Head view and partial ocean view, The lobby is small with a wierd assortment of furniture.There was continuous rock n roll music in the lobby, the one elevator and the dining room. It seemed they were trying to be a hip nightclub catering to the 20-30 year olds. I found $400-500/night really overpriced. The dinner at THe Diamond Grill was delicious and definitely the highlight. Complements to the chef. I would return for dinner ONLY.
