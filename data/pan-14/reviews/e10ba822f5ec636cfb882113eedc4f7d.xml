It was a business trip and I was a bit worried about being out of it by the airport but the combination of the excellent accommodation, shuttles to the subway and excellent subway infrastructure made this a superb stay. There is a good Irish bar within the hotel, a good gym and pool, good rooms and overall a very nice hotel. If I went back to Boston I would stay there.
