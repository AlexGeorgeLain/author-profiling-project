It is a block away from Boston Common, making it a centralized location to see everything in Boston. The hotel is near the Arlington Avenue T station and is good for getting around. Everyone should check out Gypsy Bar on Boylston, which is only a block away from the hotel. It was hopping on Saturday, though it seemed like more tourists were there than locals.The room was small; the bed took up the entire room. We would go and have breakfast at Au Bon Pain, located in the hotel or Starbucks in the mall across the street. The concierge was pleasant and helpful in making suggestions about what to do during the July 4th weekend.
