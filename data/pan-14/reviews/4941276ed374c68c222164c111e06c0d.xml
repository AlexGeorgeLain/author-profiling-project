This small hotel is a real haven after a busy sightseeing day. The staff were so helpful, particularly with suggestions of where to go and what to see in the limited time we had. The many restaurants within 50 metres were superb, especially The Sardine Room. The walk into the centre through the Botanic Gardens was lovely though there were many steps to negotiate on the way. This was fine going into the city but coming back (rather tired) we found it easier to take a 311 bus from Circular Quay! The many and efficient ferries running from the Quay offer a wealth of places to see and I would recommend Watson's Bay and South head, a bus to Bondi and a walk to Bronte or Coogee but Keith in the hotel will be happy to tell you all about where to go. A trip to the Blue Mountains is a must, but only if the weather is good. We took a guided tour which collected us from the hotel and ended with a ferry from the Olympic Park back into the city and we felt it was excellent value for money but it is possible to do it on the train. All in all we had six fantastic days and should we go back to Sydney (there are so many other places we want to see!) we would certainly stay at Simpsons.
