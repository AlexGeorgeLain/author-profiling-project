No real improvement over the entire stay. Hallways needed a good cleaning. Friends on different floor also had to ask to have room cleaned properly. So wasn't just our floor. Really was disgusting.The Hotel is located close to the subway, but it is very difficult to find good eating establishments anywhere close.Although breakfast was plentiful, there was no change to the offerings over the entire stay. Perhaps the worst eggs I have ever eaten.I would recommend a pass on this hotel, add a few extra dollars and you will get you a much better place..
