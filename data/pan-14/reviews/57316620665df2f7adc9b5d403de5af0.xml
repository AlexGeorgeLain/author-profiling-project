In need of a major overhaul. Also, didn't honor my request for a king-sized room and weren't very nice about double-checking or explaining why they had done this. Booked through the NFL for the Super Bowl, and I was a bit surprised the league, which does everything first-class, would use a place like this. Yuck.

Great location. Roomy rooms that were clean. You don't always get that in New York no matter what you pay, but in this case, I got it all ... and it didn't break the bank. I'd definitely return.
