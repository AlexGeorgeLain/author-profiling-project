The neighborhood is not pretty, but since it's this close to the city center, it didn't really matter to me.The rooms are not too big, but okay, with satellite tv, minibar and a small, but nice bathroom (with a shower). Towels and bedsheets are always clean. Breakfast's plenty. Staff is kind and polite.It's a three star-hotel with some major adjustments which make it a great deal to stay.
