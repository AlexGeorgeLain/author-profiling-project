Greta location for subway to all parts of NY as well as being close to the Village and Chelsea districts.The room was great - lots of space (we had a superior deluxe on 2nd floor) The staff were all friendly and the inclusive breakfast and all day coffee and cookies was a nice touch.Will definately return
