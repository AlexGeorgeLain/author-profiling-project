I checked out lots of reviews for this hotel before I went, so specifically asked for a room on the inner courtyard away from the street. However when we got there, we were told there wasn't such a room available! This meant that it was very noisy at night, the street seems to be a major cut-through for freight traffic, and the lights from the bars across the street came through the curtains.But other than that it is a lovely little hotel for all it's two stars, better than some three stars I've stayed in! The staff were very helpful and friendly, rooms exceptionally clean, shower had good water pressure. Beds and towels were fresh everyday and breakfast was perfectly adequate. Although would highly recommend using one of the local pattiseries for something extra special (and cheaper).Overall, would recommend IF you can get a room off the road.
