We arrived in Frankfurt around 7 am, and had previously notified the hotel we would be arriving early. They were able to accommodate an early-morning check-in for us, which we appreciated hugely. We did not fly out till the next evening, and they were also able to accommodate a late check-out. Obviously depends on what volume they are experiencing at any given time, but they were most gracious about it. Just what we needed for an overnight between 2 very long (10 and 12 hours each) flights. Spa service had an excellent masseur and very relaxing surroundings, good gym and pool. We loved our room, which had a separate sitting room. The hotel bar was a great spot to spend time for a nightcap, with pleasant piano music. Room service was prompt and efficient, as well as high quality food. The concierge provided excellent directions map for a walk along the river to the historic area, a nice restaurant recommendation for dinner, and a wine festival in town that evening. Entire staff was welcoming and helpful. All in all, excellent experience and would recommend highly.
