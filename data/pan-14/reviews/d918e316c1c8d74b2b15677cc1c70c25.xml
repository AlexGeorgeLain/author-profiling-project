The desk personnel were all friendly and helpful. The lobby is large and not too crowded and the perfect place to hang out for a long continental breakfast (I especially appreciated the ability to add a shot of espresso to my morning coffee, which was excellent) or the wine/cheese afternoon reception (wines and good, cheese plate average). The rooms are reasonable sized, attractive, with all expected amenities, large closet, bathrobes, etc.The only negatives were a bullhorn echoing most of the day in 26th street from some strikers at the New York Life building (New York: please develop livability laws like in my city) and the relative distance from theaters and shopping. I'd stay there again, but would probably stay in a sister hotel closer to the center of things.
