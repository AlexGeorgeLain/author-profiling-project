Shabby chic hotel in old part of Florence. Relatively clean, slightly rundown. Staff must have done guest services training at local prison. It was all about following THE RULES from the moment we got there until the moment we left...rules that only the staff was privy to. I.e. no one in their right mind would guess some of the requirements they had for their guests. These people are clueless. Avoid this place if you would like to have a happy memory of your stay in Florence.
