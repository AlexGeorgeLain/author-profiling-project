It started out as a luxury hotel.I loved the rooms, the staff, and the overall ambience of the property.This year, as in past years , my husband took me there for 2 nights for my birthday. They seemed to have changed their clientele from couples to families.At the pool, there was children screaming and running(with no supervision at all).Even when we went to the small beach that says ADULTS ONLY!-THERE WERE KIDS.I did tell the staff about it, but they didnt seem concerned. I still love Baleen, that is still very good food, and a really great vibe.We were there when Miami Spice was available(where you can get a 3 course dinner for a fraction of the cost normally.I told people about it that we met at the bar,but when we were seated, I had to ask the waiter for that special menu, as did the out of state couple who we met.If the hotel has changed its atmosphere and the people they want to attract, they can't bill itself as a romantic getaway.Unless your idea of a romantic weekend is a pool full of kids.I couldnt even speak to my husband without yelling.I love my own kids, but sometimes when you want to get away from it all-there is a time and place.I do hope they go back to the hotel I once loved.I'm sure there are other hotels around that fit my bill
