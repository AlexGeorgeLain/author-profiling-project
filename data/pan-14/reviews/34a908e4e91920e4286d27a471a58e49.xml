In discussing where we would stay, we decided on the Mandarin Oriental at Columbus Circle in the Time Warner Building. This was our first visit to the property and we will return many times in the future. In every way, the property and the staff achieved a 6 star level of service; within minutes of our arrival from LaGuardia via the hotel's car service, door staff, front desk staff and management were all greeting us by name! Our guest room on the 53rd floor overlooking the Hudson River, while not oversized, had a beautiful bathroom and was appointed. The bed was very comfortable and in ever way, our guest room met our every expectation. During our 6 night stay, frequently, the doorman would offer us the hotel's car service to the theatre and restaurants! The hotel's proximity to Central Park was a great advantage and we enjoyed our morning walks in the park. A great way to spend a holiday; thanks to everyone at Mandarin Oriental for making our stay so memorable.
