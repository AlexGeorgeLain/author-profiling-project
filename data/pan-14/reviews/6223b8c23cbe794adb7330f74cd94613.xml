The hotel was clean and comfortable, room 304 was spacious and there was no noise as it is situated at the back, no good if you want a view.Breakfast was adequate, Reception were excellent and extremely helpful when asked if they could tell us where we could use internet check in at the airport they did it for us and printed out our boarding passes.Where the hotel is situated is perfect to get out and about to all the wonderful museums and shopping areas.Would recommend this hotel and definately stay there again.
