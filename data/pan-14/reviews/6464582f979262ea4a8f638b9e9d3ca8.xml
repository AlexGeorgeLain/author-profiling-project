I come to N.O. every year and I try to stay in a different location each time, and I would rate this place as average. First, the location is just about as good as it gets and the building itself is interesting and quite historic. The downside is that, apart from the nice and knowledgeable consierge, the staff is sub-par. Also, some of the smaller rooms on the upper floors have paper thin walls. Good value for about 100 bucks per night though.
