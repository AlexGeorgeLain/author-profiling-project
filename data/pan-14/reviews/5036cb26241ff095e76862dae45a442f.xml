It was our first time in San Francisco, and we didn't want to stay at a chain hotel. The Hotel Rex lived up to its positive reviews, and we certainly weren't disappointed. The staff is wonderful at the hotel! We were always greeted witha smile, and any questions or requests were taken care of immediately. Great touch--the day manager brings his pug to the hotel---sweetest, most mellow dog I've seen in a while (and my girls loved him!). The bar and restaurant manager, David, had some wonderful suggestions as to where to go off the path, as well as a great dinner suggestion. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant--a small, cozy place, with very good food. We also enjoyed the complimentary glass of wine in the evenings (between 5 and 6 p.m.).The hotel is very cool in its decor. Take the time to read some of the quotes in the halls by the elevator.We were lucky to have a suite--it was spacious, and we even had two jazz cds on our bedstand. And the bed was wonderfully comfortable, especially after a long day of sightseeing!When I booked the room I mentioned that we were belatedly celebrating our daughter's 16th birthday. The satff was so gracious to all of us--and to my daughter--and even placed a bouquet of flowers and a musical birthday card in the room for her!This was a fun trip with a stay at a wonderful hotel.
