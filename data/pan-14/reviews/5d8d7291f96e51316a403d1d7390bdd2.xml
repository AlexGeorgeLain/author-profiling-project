The views are incredible from both the rooms and the 27th floor pool area. Thestaff were professional but very relaxed and made us feel at home. Our room was immaculate and tastefully furnished in a European moderndecor. The TV had plenty of cable channels available. There was no table (just a desk) or side chairs in the room but we didn't expect this in a NY hotel. We enjoyed the relatively quiet location away from Times Square but very accessible. Walk about 4 blocks to Grand Central Terminal.Bus service was also very accessible. We did not eat in hotel as there plenty of dining establishments in the area. The Plaza deli up the street has a fantastic salad bar and almost anything you could want. Was amazed at the pool and fitness area, unheard of in Manhattan. We used priceline and were assigned to this hotel after selecting a 3 star minimum. Cannot indicate a single disappointment with this property other than the lack of a table and 2 chairs which would have been nice to use for in room dining.
