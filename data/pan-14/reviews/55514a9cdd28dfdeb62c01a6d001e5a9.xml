We were met with some of the friendliest and most helpful staff we have experienced in all our travels. Everyone we interacted with (front desk, conceirge, door staff, bell staff, pool people, waiters, etc.) treated us extremely well and really made the experience. Even Socorro at the Avis counter in the hotel was extremely helpful!Our Club Intercontinental room was right by the pool, gym and spa. We apprecited the additional privacy and ability to walk right out to the pool area and the beach. The furnishings were a tasteful Caribbean motif (no over the top sea foam green and flamingo pink) with a lot of tropical wood. The onlyissues were that the sliding glass door was hard to open and close, the walls were a little on the thin side if you have really loud talkers (we have those neighbors for one day) and the ceiling in the bathroom was a little low. We used the gym. It was one of the nicest hotel gyms we have ever used. Everything was new.We did have our last lunch at the hotel's Japanese offering, Momoyama. The Pepper Tuna appetizer was amazing. The rest of the sushi was good, but nothing spectular. The staff was, again, extremely friendly.We loved this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time we are in San Juan.
