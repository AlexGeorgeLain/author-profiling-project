We are a family of 4, two adults with two children aged 11 13. The room we had contained two double beds, with everything you'd expect, tv, coffee facilities, fridge etc. The room was clean as was the bathroom. The pillows were flat, so after one night i requested three more, and they were left behind whilst we were out. The hospitality room is a god send, as we checked out at 11am, then had to wait until 8pm before we went to the airport. The hotel also has a laundry room, which after travelling for some time is also a must! We used the gym a couple of times and swam in the pool, both being clean and comfortable. One little problem which happened a few times was the lifts would stop working, so we had to walk down several flights of stairs, for us not a problem, but for older people could prove difficult. The hotel is on a corner, and there is some traffic noise throughout the night, but the location makes up for that small inconvenience. We were close to shops, supermarkets and the beach. We took a tour to the Arizona and Missouri, and had a great day out with our tour guide. We booked this through the lovely lady in the hotel lobby.I'd stay here again!
