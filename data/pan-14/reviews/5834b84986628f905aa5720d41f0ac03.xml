As my husband and I are retired we found the rooms nice and quiet at night. We will be back later in the year.

Having been there many times we always wanted to try an apartment.Booking the Citadines was a pleasant surprise. Right in the middle of Las Ramblas (which we knew).Our studio apartment turned out to be a large bedroom, very modern and a dinky little kitchen with all mod cons. Even the bathroom didn't let us down. Plenty of space everywhere.We will definately go back.

Having booked a single room for myself and a twin room for my son and his friend who were there for the football.,I got a double room with a small terrace and another surprise was that beds were adjustmatic which made comfort even better. Football match tickets were waiting at reception on our arrival.(They were booked on the net) Breakfast was not booked but I tried it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. Staff were friendly and I would certainly go back.
