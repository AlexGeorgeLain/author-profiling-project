Seems it was a Kimpton Hotel in a prior life that has been taken over by Joie de Vivre - both boutique brands I really like. Pluses - great rate $109 including internet access. Typical Kimpton/JdV style - the rooms have funky furnishings and they play movies in the lobby.What I got was a smallish room with decent furniture and workspace. The bathroom had a full size tub, but it was kind of stuck in behind the sink like it was added later. The linens weren't worthy of a Days Inn circa 1988 - thin, see-through towels and sheets that felt like they were waterproof (must have had a threadcount of about 8 or so). No in-room coffee (a pet peeve), no newspapers available at all.The free breakfast was convenience store special - pre-wrapped bagels and pastries (couldn't they at least throw out some fruit?).The staff was nice, accommodating, friendly, except the night guy who was too busy with his laptop to pay much attention to customers.The topper was coming back on night 3 to find three police officers in the lobby, one holding a shotgun. Never got the scoop on that, but wasn't the best thing to come home to.Probably adequate for real bargain hunters. For a business trip, not so much.
