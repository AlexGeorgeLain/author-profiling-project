This hotel was only about 15 mins walk from the market and about 1 min walk to the nearest underground station. The location for us could not have been much better.The room was on the 4th floor and very nice. I like having a separate shower. You can get all the English channels on the TV which is good. The only thing it lacked, if I were to be picky, was an iron and ironing board, though I'm sure we could have got one if we'd asked.We didnt have breakfast here as it was expensive, and I am a fussy eater so rarely get my money's worth from a buffet..The only negative I could find with this place, is the Asian bar. It was quite smoky... I'll be so pleased if/when they ban smoking in bars there, I hate to smell of smoke.If I were to ever go back to Frankfurt, I would have no hesitation in staying here again, or recommending it.
