The room was a Superior King room with balcony, and it was large, clean, and had a nice view of the pool area and courtyard.The staff was very friendly, and always available to offer assistance with a smile. We enjoyed dinner in their restaurant, and enjoyed talking with their bartenders, when we chose to relax and have a drink during the afternoons.Overall, it was a nice experience, and I would return to this hotel in the future.**Regarding the strange red light bulbs, mentioned in some reviews,......they are heat lamps, in the bathroom, and are provided for your comfort. They turn off and on, just like the regular light does. I am not sure why they confused so many people.The French Quarter is alive and well, and people should not hesitate to return for a vacation there.
