This is however no real problem since you have all kinds of tramway stops nearby. We were able to get to anyplace within 10-15 minutes. Furthermore, the quarter is friendly and has shops and restaurants, but there are no noisy tourists or similar.The hotel is in a (or, rather, a couple of) ancient Amsterdam houses. This and the antique interior and the classical music give it a very special atmosphere. The stairs are however really steep. This adds to the original Amsterdam feeling (all ancient A'dam houses have those stairs) but may be a little tiresome if you return after a long day sightseeing.Our room was fine and spacious as was the bathroom. But the best thing is the staff. All people we learned to know at the Washington were warm and helpful. E.g., they arranged to get us cards for a show which wasn't bookable at all from Germany. All in all, we can definitely recommend Hotel Washington. We will surely stay there when we return to Amsterdam.
