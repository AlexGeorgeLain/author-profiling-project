I can honestly say it was the best choice he could have made!This place is modern, clean and the staff are ace. Our room was furnished in a simple but modern and stylish way. It was more than adequate for our needs. The staff gave us useful tips on getting the most out of our stay, including the best tips for getting around the city and what to see that shouldn't be missed. When we stayed there the manager threw a weekly meet and greet with wine and nibbles for his guests where he mingled with everyone and sought their opinions on the hotel. This was a nice touch and a good way to get direct feedback.Great little hotel for a city break. Try it - you may like it!!!
