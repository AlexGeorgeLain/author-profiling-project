I stayed here for 2 nights in June, 2008 and we loved our room - we booked a standard room, but we had views of both the water and the city. The bathroom was large and the room had all the comforts that a Ritz should (large comfortable King bed, large marble bathroom with bath and shower, huge closets with plenty of storage room, bang and oluffson TV, stereo, etc, automatic window shades, wifi). We ordered room service a lot and the food was expensive but worth it because it actually tasted good. The pool is very nice, but get there early to reserve a chair because the pool area is not very large considering how large the hotel is. Only problem was that the safe was broken in the room and they could not fix it...

The location was perfect (in walking distance to every tourist destination). The room was very clean, very modern in furnishing, bathroom was large and modern as well. The rooftop pool was incredible. The weekend was scorching hot and it was a huge bonus to return to the hotel after a day of sightseeing and plunge into the pool. I found this hotel a very good value booked through Expedia. Would highly recommend!
