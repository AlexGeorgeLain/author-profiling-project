Our first room was on the first floor, was freezing cold, had bedside lamps that didn't work, a window 2'4' , whatever. So we asked for another room, pointing out that we'd reserved so far in advance. No luck. We were assigned another room, also on the first floor, steps from the lobby. Again, lamps that didn't work, no towel rack or hooks on the door in the bathroom, and on and on. This place is the pits. We moved out the next day and stayed at the wonderful Loews.
