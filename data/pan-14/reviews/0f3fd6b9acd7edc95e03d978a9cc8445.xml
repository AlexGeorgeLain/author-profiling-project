Bar frequented by locals and there are delis, pharmacies etc. on the doorstep.Studio room for three of us was spacious, clean, quiet and functional. Online Concierge service useful to book transport, pillows etc before arriving. Don't book a car back as it is much cheaper - $50 cheaper to get a taxi from outside the hotel.Will definitely book again.
