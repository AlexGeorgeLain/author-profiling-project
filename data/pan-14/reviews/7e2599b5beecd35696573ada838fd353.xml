On arrival there was a balcony on a small room and no ocean view. The staff was unapologetic and kept us at the hotel for over 2 hours promising something better. Gansevoort South was contacted by the travel agency to make right on the specifics of the reservation. The management continued to offer sub par rooms including smoking room and ill cleaned room. In the end, the travel agent booked us at The Tides. We couldn't have been more thrilled. At The Tides service was paramount. From location to service all things were better and supreme at The Tides. If you want a great stay in Miami Beach I highly reccommend The Tides and anywhere else other than Gansevoort South

Went with fiance. Great for couples. Had a really great time. It was fun in the sun. Staff great at involving guests in all sorts of activities- can't remember names but everyone was great. We played water polo, baseball, volleyball, ring toss (winner gets a bottle of RUM!) and more. Horseback riding on the beach was crowded and controlled but fun- and included! If we weren't up to being active we stayed at the pool or beach and wait staff came to us with drinks and snacks. Great Pina Coladas! One thing we really liked was being able to get room service at nearly any hour. Never the lack of food. Some options were better than others- Kudos to the French restaurant. Overall has a really good time. Restored our faith in all-inclusives.
