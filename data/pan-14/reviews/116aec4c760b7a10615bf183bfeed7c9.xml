When we arrived, we were supposed to get parking for our car; however, upon our arrival we were told that there wad no more spots available so we should park in the public garage over one block away. We were not told at the time of the reservation that parking was not always available. The rooftop pool was in disrepair as the wood was not in good condition and even more important the pool was the size of a very tiny private pool. We were shocked at how small the pool was. The sundeck did not have enough chairs nor towels. We have traveled extensively and throught that this hotel would be good based on the web pictures; however, the pictures are real deceiving. We would never go back to this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone.
