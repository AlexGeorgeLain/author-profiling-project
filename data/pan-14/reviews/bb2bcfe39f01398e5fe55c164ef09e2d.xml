We liked the room, size was ok and the basics were there (TV, mini bar, desk), there was a small couch and a table. Bathroom was very nice, shower was excellent. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets and and room seemed clean. The air conditioning worked ok, didn't cool that much, was more about blowing air into the room. We were lucky, the weather wasn't too hot.Location was perfect, close to everything, Placa Catalunya and, Las Ramblas. It was great to be able to walk around the city and stop by the hotel to change shoes, drop off shopping bags etc.We did find an enormous cockroach in the bathroom one morning, which really put me off. We told the receptionist and he didn't believe us (!). Otherwise staff was very friendly and helpful. All in all, a good experience, but the cockroach did affect our overall impression of the hotel.Stayed on the 5th floor and didn't have to take two elevators (as mentioned by other reviewer).
