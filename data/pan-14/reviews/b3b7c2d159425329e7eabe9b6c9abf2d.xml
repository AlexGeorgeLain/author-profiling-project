The location is ideal for a break in Florence as it is near most of the sites you may want to visit. The rooms are beautiful and contain many original features. The hotel is clean and well maintained. It was not overrun with staff during our visit and for most of the time it seemed there was only one member of staff on the premises. He or she worked at Reception but left there if you wanted a drink from the bar or to take something to your room. More staff appeared in the mornings to serve breakfast and to service the rooms. The staff that we did have contact with were friendly and willing to help. The public rooms on the ground floor were not used very much during our stay and were not really designed for many guests to congregate at one time. On the whole, we were glad we found Il Guelfo Bianco. It is friendly, clean, well maintained and ideally located.
