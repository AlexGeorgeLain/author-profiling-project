I was on a two-week trip to Asia (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Hong Kong) and stayed in five-star hotels at each destination, but the Peninsula stood above the rest.We arrived late and were taken directly to our rooms to check in (always a treat to skip the front desk). We had 1 Grand Deluxe Harbor View Room and 1 Grand Deluxe Harbor View Suite for our party of four. Parents were in the suite, kids were in the room. Both were absolutely lovely. We were in the newer part of the hotel so everything was fresh and perfectly clean. The artwork was impressive, the beds were very comfortable, the bedside controller was fun (turned the lights on/off, opened/closed curtains, turned the TV on/off, etc., etc.), the bathroom was well-equipped -- even the fruit was exotic, tasty, and beautiful. Most impressive, however, were the views. Stunning.Service is the room was impeccable. Everyone from the maid to the woman who picked up the laundry to the room service deliverer was cheerful, friendly, and efficient. Every request was carried out quickly and correctly.The lobby was even more beautiful than the rooms. The surrounding shops are only the creme de la creme. Afternoon tea is authentic and tasty. Staff members are everywhere and seem to anticipate your needs before you express them. It even smells heavenly.One of my favorite parts of this hotel was the fleet of Rolls-Royces. We rented one on a few occassions during our stay and it was great fun -- don't miss it. The spa was also wonderful.I travel extensively and have high standards and this property rates very highly in my book.
