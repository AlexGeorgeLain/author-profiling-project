Check-in was smooth and courteous. The room, while small, was I think one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in. The bathroom had a nice shower with a rainfall style showerhead, and was nicely decorated (marble top on a washstand vanity, vintage style light fixtures). I was expecting the room to have a queen size bed, but this room had a king. The bed was extremely comfortable, with nice pillows and a fluffy comforter. Housekeeping did an excellent job throught my stay. The room includes a flat screen TV, a DVD player, a minibar that I used as a refrigerator, CD alarm clock, comfy lounge chair and a desk and chair. The 9th floor had only been open for about a week so there were still a few issues. I had to call to get the electronic safe activated and have an iron delivered, but these items were taken care of quickly. 2 things I would change would be to add an additional outlet near the desk to pull in electronics and additional soundproofing on the windows, as there was significant noise from sirens. There is a small gym on the 1st floor, but no pool. I would stay here again if I could get another deal similiar to the price I paid this time.
