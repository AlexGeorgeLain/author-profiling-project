The hotel was in a great location (one stop from Ginza on the subway, 10 minute walk to both Ginza and the Tsujuki Fish Market, and on the direct JR line to Narita airport), the rooms were well maintained and the staff were extremely friendly. Would definitely come back if I return to Tokyo.Requested an extra bed when booking and upon arrival the bed was already in the room. In three weeks of traveling through Asia, this was the only hotel where this happened. Didnt try breakfast or the restaurants, but there are plenty of stores, restaurants, and coffee shops in the neighborhood. There is a Tully's Coffee directly outside the hotel that was great for mornings.Staff were all very helpful and nice. The lobby area is very spacious and well maintained as well. Booked a great rate (for Tokyo at least) on Expedia, and recommend checking there before you book this hotel.
