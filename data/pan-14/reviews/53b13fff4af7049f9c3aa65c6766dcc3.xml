They had a courtesy shuttle to the port, but the driver charged us a $2 per person luggage handling fee. The place is run down. They advertise a fitness room, but 3 out of the 5 machines were broken and it was filthy! Also, there is NOTHING around there. Although I have to say; the shuttle picked us up promptly at the airport, and the front desk people were very nice to us. But it really kind of grossed me out!
