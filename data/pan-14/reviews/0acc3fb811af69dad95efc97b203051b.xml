After mind boggling searches for the PERFECT hotel.,I think I have found it. Hotel de Varenne is sophisticated without being pretentious. Staff helpful and courteous. Great location.Very peaceful nights sleep. Pleasantly surprised by the bathroom size as I'd been lead to believe all hotel bathrooms in Paris are tiny. I hope to return to Hotel de Varenne to enjoy this lovely place again.
