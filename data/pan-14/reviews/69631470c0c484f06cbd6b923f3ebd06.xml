Much bigger than the average NYC room and very modern. BUT... (1) The hotel double-charged me. I used a different credit card at check-in, not the one I used to guarantee the room, then the hotel charged both cards. I must say that on New Year's Eve evening they were very helpful when I called them about it and they had one of the charges credited back to me immediately, but if the lady that checked us in had not spent most of the time on the telephone, maybe the mistake wouldn't have happened! (2) The elevators are a problem. Not as bad as some of the reviews have indicated, but it is a bothersome issue. A word to the wise...when you see room on an elevator, get in! Regardless of where the elevator might be headed, get in one when you can. And try to avoid the 8th floor. That's where check-in, shops and lounges are and as a result where most of the people are...take an escalator to a lower floor if you're on the 8th and you won't have as many people to fight with. (3) The hotel is very slow to pick up room service trays. At one point, there were three trays sitting outside of rooms on our floor and they smelled very much. We had to call to get them removed. The next day, the remains of someone's breakfast stayed in the hallway until the next morning (appx. 24 hrs.). The location of this hotel is wonderful, but you can probably do better and spend a lot less!
