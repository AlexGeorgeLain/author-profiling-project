It's clean, freshly decorated and convenient for a number of businesses but it's too far from the heart of Amsterdam. Taxis take ages to arrive and cost to get in. I really hated the electronically locked front doors that mean you need to summon assistance to get in or out, day or night. Can only recommend for travellers that need to sleep then get to the office early.
