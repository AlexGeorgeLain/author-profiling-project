The front desk was exeptional, the room was large and very confortable, the restaurant was good for dinner and had a wonderful breakfast buffet, and the convenience to the airport was perfect. If you are a Holiday Inn Club member they have 3 special floors, parking at the door, fruit candy in your room, and a special check-in area. First class establishment used by several cruise lines.
