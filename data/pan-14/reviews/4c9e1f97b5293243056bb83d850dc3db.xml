Everything about the hotel itself is more or less average, but its location on Meinekestrasse takes it into the above average category. A block off the top of Kufurstendam, two blocks from Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Plenty of restaurants, shops and activity in the immediate neighborhood. Three or four U-bahn lines stop within a block or two. The hop-on/hop-off tour bus originates a block away. Convenient for arrival by train; the Zoo railway station is a five-minute walk from the hotel. If arriving by plane at Tegel Airport, take bus #109 and ask to be let off at Ulandstrasse. Continue walking two blocks in the same direction and turn right on Meinekestrasse. The hotel is large and caters mostly to groups and business travelers.
