The checkin staff was wonderful, my housekeeper was extra friendly and was always careful to try to leave the room just as I would like it. The breakfast in the grill is outstanding; I have never seen anything so beautiful and delicious. The papaya and strawberries were the best, fresh muffins, eggs anyway you want them, bacon, sausage, etc, potatoes, cereals, juices, hot cakes, waffles, There was much more but too much to describe. I was honestly not hungry till dinnertime. My room was spotless. I had a partial ocean view and my room was quiet and the a/c worked great. This hotel is in perfect location for everything you would want to do. I can't imagine a better place to stay.
