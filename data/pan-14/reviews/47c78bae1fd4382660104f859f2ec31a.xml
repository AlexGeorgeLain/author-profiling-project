The staff was exceptional - very friendly and helpful. Another guest who spoke limited Englished asked my wife and I for information about when the Queen Mary II was due to arrive - I called the front desk and they looked up the information on the Internet and called the woman back with the information. Later than night my wife and I headed out for dinner and a show and the front desk clerk offered two of their larger umbrella's in place of our small travel one - they didn't have to do that but I am convinced the staff have the guests best interests at heart.The rooms are small - smaller than I'd experienced in other 'business' hotels in NYC, but it was manageable. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and even being right next to the theatre where 'Rent' is playing, it was quiet. The hotel offers free continental breakfasts - coffee, juice and rolls. Nothing spectacular, but it's included in the room cost. The location is great for tourists - one block south of 42nd St in between 7th and 8th with lots of shopping and dining options. If someone else was paying, I'd stay at a larger hotel, but to travel to NYC on our own nickle, we'd stay there again.
