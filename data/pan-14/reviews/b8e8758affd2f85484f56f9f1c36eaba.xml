We arrived around 11 a.m. They suggested that they hold our bags and deliver them to the room while we were out. Check-in is a very reasonable 3 p.m. When we returned around 4:30 our bags were in our room. Much to our surprise we had been upgraded to a suite.A very nice wine, fruit and cheese display was offered around 5 p.m. In addition, breakfast was offered in the morning in the lobby. For five dollars, they will bring it to your room at your requested time. There is a lovely rooftop bar too. All and all I can't think of a single want that was neglected. The staff was very helpful and courteous.Our prior favorite hotel in the city had been the SoHo Grand but we will return here next time.
