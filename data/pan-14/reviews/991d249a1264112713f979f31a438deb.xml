It was precisely what we wanted - spacious, clean, quiet, and with great features. The room came with free internet supplied through a very swanky 20-something inch iMac which also functioned as the TV - and the reception handed out free DVDs to watch on it. The bar was expensive, but very swanky. The gym looked nice, but we're far too lazy to have used it.It's not exactly close to the fun stuff - it's near Lambeth Bridge so it's close to Parliament and the Thames, but it's a bit of a walk into Leicester Square etc. That's a very, very minor thing though, I love this hotel, and I definitely intend to go back.

		<document id="f4b640ed854fd7df6cb1ca53cb2f97a4" url=""><![CDATA[Huge room, quiet location We stayed here based on the reviews on Trip Advisor - it's a great place, but I feel like it's a bit over-hyped.The rooms are massive - loads of empty floor space - and they have proper kitchens and large bathrooms. There's about 20 light switches, all with dimmers, which I found fascinating because I have the brain of a 4 year old. There's a spacious fridge and an actual gas oven in the room, though ours was busted (couldnt get the pilot light to come on - we didnt need it so we assumed it was off for a reason and left it).The hotel lobby and corridors are cramped, which makes the size of the rooms a nice surprise. The 2nd floor seems to be dedicated to the spa and gym - we didnt use those, but we did nose around it a bit... I queued for the lobby ATM surrounded by the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, which was great (the hotel is big on its fitness - they even have a menu of pillows that do stuff to you in your sleep).Internet is through the TV - shockingly, the only non-HD TV I saw out of 4 American hotels on this trip (not even widescreen, I was aghast...) - and cost $10 a day, so I stayed away from it. Also, the keyboard was broken, and we had to get an engineer to fix it.Food comes from the next door Barking Dog restaurant, it's not proper room service food, but it's cheap-ish and very large portions. Nice place for breakfast.Careful with the bathroom taps - my girlfriend turned one too far left and it broke, nearly flooding our room... the engineer who fixed it was cool though, seems it happens often...Location-wise, the hotel is strange. It's on the same street as the Empire State and Macys, yet somehow feels out of the way. The subway is 2 blocks away, which isn't too bad, and there's a lot of places to eat nearby. I felt like it was oddly quiet, being so near the touristy stuff...Overall, the hotel was a joy to stay in - hugely comfortable, well located, quiet and with average staff (they were a bit dismissive, but not offensively so...) - it's not perfect, but it is a good luxury place to get away with your boy/girlfriend...

The rooms are suites in the proper sense of the word - our standard suite had 4 rooms, 2 large HD TVs, lounge with seating for 4, a microwave, fridge... And it was very cheap for the quality of service, and the location.The hotel is right next to Yonge street, so there's a huge shopping mall within 5 minutes walk, and the CN tower is a long-ish but pleasant 15 minute walk away. The view from our room was great as it was snowing, but would probably be less impressive in the summer...The lobby and halls are softly lit and feel really warm and homely. A big team of housekeepers are constantly moving about in the (insanely slow) lifts - the place feels really well looked after and well staffed. The desk and housekeeping staff were all lovely.I can't recommend this place enough, it was very relaxing, hugely spacious and great value for our money. Perfect for couples getting away to relax.
