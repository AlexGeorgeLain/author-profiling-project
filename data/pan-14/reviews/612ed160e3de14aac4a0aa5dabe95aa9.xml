We had chosen it due to excellent reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. On checking-in we were upgraded to a junior suite which was extremely spacious - especially for a room in NYC and we had a fantastic view south down 3rd Ave. The staff were fantastic, helpful and really friendly - Eduardo on reception, Sid the Concierge and the doorman to name a few. They made us feel right at home. We loved the extra touches such as the free cheese and wine in the evening and free tea and coffee. We thought the hotel was stylish and welcoming and will definately return here next time we come to NYC! I will certainly be recommending the Affinia 50 to my friends.
