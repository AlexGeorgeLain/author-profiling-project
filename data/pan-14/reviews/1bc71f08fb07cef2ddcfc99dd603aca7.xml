The hotel is pretty basic (a 3rd floor) but immaculately clean and the rooms are very nice and well kept. Considering we were at the very heart of Florence (a 20 seconds walk to the Duomo, literally) I could say the price was really reasonable (and as we were spending 3 nights there we had a discount rate). The staff was really nice and helpful and they offer a free glass of wine between 6 and 7 or 8, I remember exactly. no problem if you are arriving by car. Ask at reception and arrange a parking solution for you. a private parking nearby and they come and collect the car and they bring it back when leaving. rather expensive, though, 24 euros a day, but you really have much choice.The only but is that the breakfast room is very small and it gets crowded in the morning so probably have to wait for other people to finish their breakfast before you can have a seat.
