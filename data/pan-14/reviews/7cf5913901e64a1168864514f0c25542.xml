My work moved offices near Times Square and I figured i'd try a few different hotels to figure out what is best. I tried the Hotel Mela on this trip and overall left unimpressed.The good: Staff is very friendly and helpful. Location is near Times Square. Very easy to get to.The bad: I didn't really enjoy my stay. The hotel's elevators are tiny. I'm not a big guy, but they were very cramped and could hold 3 or 4 people max.My room was tiny. I stayed in their standard queen room and it was the smallest room i've ever stayed in. It had no closet but instead had a tiny Armoire. The problem was this was filled with a safe and a wine chiller and wine glasses, thus hanging any clothing in it wasn't possible. Thus, I hung my clothes in the bathroom. The room also had a small flat panel screen and two tiny nightstands attached to the wall. The room was dark and not well lit. A nice light would have been great. The room had no room for my luggage and was about one foot larger than the bed, thus, there was no place to sit or walk around. It was the bed, a door and the bathroom. Not very comfortable - reminded me of the Ibis hotels in Europe + Ikea furniture. The bed was comfortable and clean though. But the floor had stains on the capet.The bathroom was marble and nice but not very clean. The shower had a number of hairs in it and some slight mold build-up. I couldn't get hot water at night, though it worked to some extent in the morning. The bathroom was small but fairly comfortable. H20 spa amenities were nice.Other problems are thin walls. I heard absolutely everything my neighbors were doing and could hear all conversations in the hallway.Also, there is construction next door which promptly woke me up at 7AM. The construction was extremely loud. If I knew about it, I wouldn't stay there until it was over.The Mela was in the middle of my price range. I think there are much better values around Times Square than this place. And rooms nearby at other hotels are much bigger.If I got an amazing deal (i.e. under $200) i'd consider staying here, but otherwise there are much better choices.

As far as San Juan resorts and hotels go, this is about the best there is. The hotel is located about 1/2 a mile from the Airport. This makes it very close by if flying in, but also causes some airport noise to be heard in the resort.The grounds of the hotel are superb. The pool area and hot tub are beautiful, well kept and large. The beach of cleaned and the staff makes sure it is well kept as well. There are tons of chairs and umbrellas. No matter what time you go to the pool or beach, there were chairs waiting.Service is superb. Whenever we needed something it was done quickly and professionally.The casino is a decent size for a San Juan casino and the dealers are friendly enough. It had a few tables and was open 24 hours unlike some others.The rooms are standard Ritz rooms. Marble baths, flat screen tvs, etc. This Ritz property, i'd put at the lower end of Ritz hotels. Its nor particularly modern or stylish but is comfortable. The bed was very soft. Our room, facing the airport (City view) had a view of a runway. We did not ever hear airplanes from our room though. The room had high speed internet which was included in the resort fee.As others have noted, food and drink are EXPENSIVE. Mixed drinks are around $14 each, beers $6 and food - $18 for a burger and $22 for a cob salad with chicken. That being said, a Dennys and other restaurants are next door if you want to save a few bucks.Our only complaint was the humidity in the hotel. The hotel hallways had a certain mildew-ish smell and our room was very humid. No matter if we had the AC or not, it was unbelievable humid in our room to a point where all papers and clothing were just a wet mess by the end of our stay. We would have liked to see a de-humidifer or something in the property.Other than that, no complaints at all. The Ritz made for a wonderful mini vacation.

The split room thing is a little wierd. We only used the small room a few times to watch tv.The hotel is perfectly located on a busy street in Raval off the Lambras. The hotel is beautiful in a simple artsy way and 100% clean. The staff is friendly, speaks perfect english, and was very helpful during our stay when one of the people traveling with us got their wallet stolen.The room was a great size. Bed was very very comfortable. The rain shower is amazing. Possibly the best shower i've had in a long time. The rooms are quiet.The food during the day is great - little sandwiches, water, sodas, etc. The breakfast is great as well. We had delcious omlettes and eggs every day.There is a free computer and printer in the lobby and wifi.Amazing hotel. I'd stay again in a second.

The area is lively, though extremely touristy. If you are a first time visitor to Paris, the 5th is recommended. That being said, i've stayed at some really good hotels and some really bad ones in the 5th. I'll put the Albe in the 7/10 range, not the best, certainly not the worst.As for my stay at d'Albe, I decided to give it a try because of an amazing deal I got on the web. I paid a discounted rate for 3 nights and got a 4th night free and a free breakfast every morning. If I was paying full rate (or nearly full rate) I would have been disappointed with my room.Location: Smack dab in the middle of the Latin Quarter. This is good and bad. This is good because you can walk or metro or cab to nearly anywhere quickly. This is bad because d'Albe is located on a pedestrian street. Some cab drivers will drop you off at the front of the hotel. Some will not. Thus, you may have to drag your luggage through crowds to get to the hotel.The lobby: The lobby is very modern and fresh looking.The staff: The staff is friendly enough. They made a reservation for us. Though I had a few problems here and there where the staff would take a smoke break and lock the front hotel door. Thus I had to lounge around out front of the hotel and wait for them to get back to open the door again. This generally happened only later at night (11pm-1am)The room: Small like most of Paris hotels that are not outrageously expensive. It had a safe and a flat panel TV. It had a tiny desk. It had a tiny closet. The room also had a small bathroom. We did not have a tub. We only had a shower stall (i'm American so shower stall is aok). The room looked like it was sort of remodeled recently. Maybe fresher carpet but definitely showing age. The lights flickered a lot. It only had one outlet to charge my phone/camera/computer. The bathroom showed a bit of age. The shower was not as clean as I hoped, a bit of mold here and there. The toilet ran unless you gave it a whack. I also could rarely get consistent hot water in the morning, though hot water flowed freely after 3pm. (I checked with others staying and they had similar problems). The air conditioning worked wonderfully. I could make the room freezing.Breakfast: They get danishes and croissants from the bakery next door so it was all fresh. They had coffee, cheese, some hard boiled eggs and ham. For free it was very nice. For pay, you can walk next door and get a fresh hot danish for a euro or two.Overall, I didn't love it. It was very mediocre. For around the same price, there are a lot of hotels in the area that are nicer. If I got a deal again, i'd probably stay. If I had to pay normal rates, i'd choose elsewhere. I don't quite see the fascination on TA about the hotel.

Questionable service My company has an agreement with the Magnolia so that is where everyone stays when in Dallas.The hotel is centrally located in downtown Dallas. The area is pretty much dead except during weekdays. The hotel is in a historic building. It looks fairly recently renovated. Nice touches of the hotel: Free breakfast, free drinks for happy hour and free cookies at night.The good: Bed is very comfortable. I like hard beds and had a wonderful sleep. Others on my trip commented how comfy the beds were as well. The room had a nice workspace, a tv, a fridge and a nice sized closet.The bad/okay: The bathroom didn't appear to be the cleanest. The toilet was leaking a bit in my room and there was a rust spot behind it. The bathroom floor also didn't appear to be that clean. (The rest of the room was immaculate though.) The internet is wireless and it is horribly slow. I also didn't like the staff. They seems a bit cocky when asked for questions. My room was also not made up and I had to pressure to front desk to get my room made. Nothing worse than coming back from a long day of meetings to find your towels wet and bed still a mess.Overall, the stay was fine. Its certainly not the most luxurious, but it is pretty nice and if you can get a good deal, by all means stay there.
