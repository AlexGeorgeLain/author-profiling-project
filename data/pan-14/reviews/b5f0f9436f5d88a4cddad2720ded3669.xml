As we were checking out in the morning, a guest with her dog had walked through the lobby to go outside and along the way the dog had feceted all through the lobby and guests were stepping in and rolling their luggage in it throughout the lobby. What an awful and smelling experience. When it was reported to the desk clerk, she was not concerned about it all, saying she would have the dog's owner clean it up when she came back in. When the dog's owner came back into the lobby which was several minutes later, the clerk asked her to wipe it up and all she did was grab some paper towels and rub it deeper into the carpet. It was the most disguisting experience I've ever witnessed in a hotel. The hotel clerk or guest with the dog did not apologize to any of the guests in the lobby for what happened. We had to take our luggage and our shoes into the restroom to clean them off but they still smelled for hours after that. It was awful!!!!!!!!!! We will never stay there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
