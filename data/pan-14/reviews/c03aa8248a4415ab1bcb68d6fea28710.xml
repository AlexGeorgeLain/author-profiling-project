Such a magnificent deal indeed considering the well-appointed room and exceptionally courteous staff! Our only small disappointments in our 2-night stay were the confined hanging space in the closet and our dismal inner courtyard view (but didn't request a change given that we had such a low rate and also we weren't spending much time in the room.) A tip: Apply for a Sofitel privilege card, which allows you to delay checkout until mid-afternoon. We were most grateful for the extra hours to fit in one more museum excursion and excellent lunch at Oyamel Cocina Mexicana.
