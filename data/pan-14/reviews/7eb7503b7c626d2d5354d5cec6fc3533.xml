Th Cornell Hotel had availability at $165/night. I was prepared for a basic hotel, but was still disappointed. Joan was friendly on the phone. Arrival - man in the evening was not friendly, not hospitable, and without personality. Room - walked in and all I could smell or take in was the mildew/damp odor. We had a two night reservation - my friend left after the first night with severe allergy issues. Room has no A/C - left windows open to cool the room, which resulted in very little sleep b/c of the street noise.
