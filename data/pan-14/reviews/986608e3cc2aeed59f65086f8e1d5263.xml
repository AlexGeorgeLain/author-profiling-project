As on our last stay, we had a wonderful time. The property has gone through some renovations since we were last there, and the rooms are nicer with widescreen televisions.Everyone there was exceptionally nice, and even when we had a leak coming from the room above us, it was taken care of so fast that it didnt cause us a problem at all.Special thanks to Glenn at the Front Desk! He was very helpful and nice.
