It's simple, but the rooms are clean, relatively spacious, and quite comfortable. The free wireless internet worked like a charm, and the free breakfast was quite good. The only minor complaint? A group of women staying in the room next door sometimes got a bit loud, and it sounded at times as though they were in our room. I think the walls are a bit thin, but generally, our room was very quiet, especially for a hotel in Times Square. I'd return in a heartbeat.

The staff will do almost anything to make sure your stay is pleasant. The hotel is in a real neighborhood, with plenty of shops and restaurants frequented by locals, with the Metro and RER trains only about 5 minutes away. Rooms are a bit small, but are quite comfortable, and are decorated nicely, and ours had a balcony. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

The chair had a gash in it and what appeared to be blood stains. I'm not sure what the basis is for all the praise from other reviewers. Definitely mediocre at best.
