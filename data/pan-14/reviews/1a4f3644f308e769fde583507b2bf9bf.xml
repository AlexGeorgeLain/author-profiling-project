As a guy, if I were traveling alone, I wouldn't mind staying here. However, don't come here if you are looking for a romantic experience. Our bathroom door wouldn't close and had tiles falling off the walls. That being said, the rest of the room was decent and they do appear to be doing renovations throughout the hotel. The neighborhood is decently safe but unattractive. I probably would not stay there again if I could find another hotel in the same price range.
