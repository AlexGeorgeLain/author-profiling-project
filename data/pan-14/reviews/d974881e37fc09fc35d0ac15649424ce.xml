It has a fantastic location right in the centre of times square which is great as empire state, rockerfeller, fifth avenue and macy's are all in walking distance. We had no problems with the elevators, the longest wait being about 5 minutes. There are two starbucks in the hotel which open extremely early and are fantastic for that early morning thirst!We ate in the revolving view restaurant which was okay - the food was good but extremely fussy and there was only a limited choice on the pre-theatre menu. It was a good experience but unless you are celebrating something special it isn't worth the $65 price tag for 2 courses (that's without drinks!) The bar menu on the 8th floor is much better (the potato skins are fab!) and you still get a good view of times square.The rooms are large and the beds are extremely comfortable. We had a standard room and our friends had a corner room which was supposed to be larger but we couldn't really see much difference. We were on the 25th floor and didn't hear any noise at all from the street. Our friends on the 14th floor also said their room was generally quiet but the whistles of the concierge calling taxi's started early and could be heard in their room.If you want to do any of the themed tours such as the sex and the city tour, movie loaction tour or the soprano's tour then book before you go as both were full for our entire 5 day trip. The hotel does have a small office on the 8th floor that will book trips but they only accept cash, travellers cheques or american express - no other credit cards.
