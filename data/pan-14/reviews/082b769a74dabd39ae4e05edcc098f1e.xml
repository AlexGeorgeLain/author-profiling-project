We got a special via Travelocity at only $85 USD per night with $25 Canadian parking and it was truely a treat.The rooms are small, in fact, very small, as are the bathrooms but are well furnished. The kitchen won't prepare anything unless you can cook with a microwave but the fridge was large for a mini.King size beds and very comfortable. Quiet in all respects.The higher the floor the larger the room and the better the view. Our's was the 13th and it barely could see the lake. It goes up to over 40.Don't bring a car if you can avoid it. The limo service is free but requires an advance reservation, not always available. The subway is just next door and goes about wherever most tourist sites are.Grocery stores are nearby and fairly cheap. Go northeast, not south or west.The lobby and bar are great. Free newspaper.Highly recommended, especially if you get a prepaid deal as we did.
