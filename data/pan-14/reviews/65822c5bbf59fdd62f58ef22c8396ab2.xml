Its clean, pretty spacious, reasonably priced, good location for Union Square, close to cable car (one block) for other areas. Having read the reviews on here about the bad location I was mildly concerned and then on arrival at the hotel we were given a map and told not to go to the streets behind the hotel so this did raise alarm bells but to be honest you are only a block away from the thick of tourist hustle of Union Square and about a 1 minute walk down the street from the Hilton and the Nikko which is really quite upmarket. We did venture down to the Civic Centre which meant walking through the Tenderloin area which was ok, there are a few oddballs around but there are also a lot of city workers there too. Generally, i felt pretty safe all the time. The breakfast is ok, it is just muffins, bagels, coffee and tea and to be honest there's no one serving so the drinks do run out but you can get someones attention if need be. The staff are ok, not overly polite but to be honest we didn't really require their services during our stay. We were in a room facing the street and it was a bit noisy over Friday and Saturday night but nothing out of the ordinary in a city.I would stay here again if working to the same budget.
