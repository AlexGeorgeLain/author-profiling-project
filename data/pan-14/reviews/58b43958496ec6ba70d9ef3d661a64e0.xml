The rooms and service were exceptional. The web site offered suites at HK $2,000 dbl. including a huge breakfast and a club room stocked with wine and food and goodies.The regular rooms at $1,570 dbl. were outstanding.Subway entrance located within the complex - 3 stops, and about 7 minutes to the waterfront, and continues to hk island central.Can't imagine that there's a better price - performer in HK !
