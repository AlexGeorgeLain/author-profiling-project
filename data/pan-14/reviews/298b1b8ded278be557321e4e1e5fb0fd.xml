They put me in rm 112, the quietest room in the building. Usually, it was very quiet and private. On one weekend, there was a party or something nearby, perhaps at the restaurant downstairs, and it was noisy (but not really loud) with hip hop playing. Otherwise, the stay was extremely pleasant. The staff were polite and knew a good deal about the surrounding businesses. Among the better recommendations are Herbivore, an EXCELLENT vegan restaurant two blocks away, and Film Yard Video, a welcoming movie rental shop about three blocks away. Both are north of the hotel.I especially liked the chambermaid service. They figured out quickly what our schedule and preferences were. Thus there were very few knocks when we were in the room after the first two days.The hotel is beautifully kept, well-managed, and clean.I do recommend booking directly if you are staying for 7 or more days, as the booker takes your 10% discount as its commission otherwise. I was very displeased about this, and this was the one thing that I take points off for in the customer service area. I had called about combining my reservations and getting a quiet room and had learned about the discount. When I spoke to the manager, he told me the above scenario and wouldn't give me the discount.
