The lobby all rooms including dinning/breakfast were very small. Place is always packed with tourist groups and crammed. Staff was VERY unfriendly and quite rude when I provided them with my Priority Club membership--there were of no help organizing my bill on time and providing me with extra towels pillows. DO NOT STAY HERE !
