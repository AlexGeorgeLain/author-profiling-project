Rooms are a decent size, clean and fairly comfortable. We had a room with a kitchenette, as expected the kitchen facilities fantastic, one stove work, there a lot of cooking utensils, but we could get by to save some costs of eating out. Free internet and printing service is great. Also has secure parking.
