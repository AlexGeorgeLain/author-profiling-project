We booked this vaction in Oct/05 even before the resort opened for a great price. Started reading the reviews as soon as they beacame available thru tripadvisor and thought that we booked a bad vaction spot. Let me tell you if you can put up with a few flies flying around and a small toilet you will have the best vaction ever. We were in paradise once we walked in this beautiful resort, friendliest people you would ever meet and yes they speak english. Food was simply amazing anything you wanted was there, four of us not one problem with stomach. Drinks were great no problem in getting smirnoff vodka at no extra cost. Rooms were big and beds were very comfortable pillows a liitle small but get two. Anamation team was great always around trying to make your vaction the best possible. If you go around and try and find the little things you will find them but the overall experience of this place is simply amazing. Remember your not in Canada and quality of construction is not the same but it is done to the best of their knowledge and it looks great. Believe me you will love this place, don't think twice just book and you will see paradise.
