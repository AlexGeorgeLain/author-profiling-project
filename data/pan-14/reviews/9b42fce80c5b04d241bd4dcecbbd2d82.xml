There was a group a little bit younger than myself staying at the hotel and they were very friendly. I would classify this place as a cross between a hostel and a hotel. It was very clean and the staff was very helpful, but one of the blinds in my room was stuck up. It may still be that way. They helped me schedule a tour of the bioilluminescent bay (which was absolutely fantastic). Don't expect too much from the store. It's mostly junk food. Honestly though, this was my favorite part of my trip to Puerto Rico and I kind of wish I had stayed longer.
