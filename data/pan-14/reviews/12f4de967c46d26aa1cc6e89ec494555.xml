Date: Novembre 22-24Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Puerto RicoStaying for a weekend at La Concha hotel was the best experience in a long time after visiting diferents hotels at diferents destiantion. Right from the moment of arrival the service was first class! The employees how attended me and the needs of my mother where excelents. Handling every request at it's best. I was attended by Frankie aponte, who delivered an outstanding orientation service about how to enjoy the hotel at its best, he actually took me around the hotel facilities and he made sure that we had every single detail cover. He took me to see the facilities of PERLAS Restaurant that looks like a fancy high class English Ballroom, wich I recomend for that romantic dinner or just for the best treat of the family. The Bedroom was a millionare luxury ocean front property with a great atmotfere. I called room service for coffe and within 5 five minutes they where knocking at my door with it. I shared great memories with others visitors and tourist staying at the hotel too wich made my time even better. On last day I spoke with Hotel staff Mr. Casannova who also gave us that warm feeling of what great service is all about and made sure that we had a memorable time. If You want to feel like a millionare for a couple days in your vacation in PR, I highly recomend this great , luxury and affordable hotel in wich you will be getting pampered and be treat as part of a Royal Family. I will actually stay there again for my wedding night before departing for a carribbean cruise. Thank's.Gonzalez, Puerto Rico.
