The hotel is located just around the corner from the train station and is also within walking distance of the Domo, Uffizzi and is about 20 minutes from the River Arno.I was very impressed with this hotel. The front lobby and breakfast room were nicely decorated with lots of antiques and frescos on the walls. The front desk staff were very helpful.The room was also nicely decorated and included an ensuite bathroom, mini fridge and flat screen tv. The continential breakfast was great! I was impressed with the variety of breakfast items that included bread, cheese, meats, fruit, yogurt, orange juice, coffee, tea and sweets.The only reason I would not rate this hotel higher is because of the noise from the street below. Out of 3 nights I only had one night of uninterupted sleep. I really hate to give this hotel such a bad rating because it was really good - if you decide to stay here, please ask for a room on the upper floor, and one that looks out over the court yard, not the street.
