My sense is New Orleans books few conventions during September because of hurricanes, so we got a very nice price at this celebrated hotel. Our first visit.A nice welcome upon checking in and an upgrade to a small suite! Wonderful. Avoided the hotel parking fee of $30+ a day by parking one block away in an open air lot on Poydras Street. Later in the day, I told the front desk that the air conditioning was not working well in the bedroom and they agreed to fix it while we were out for dinner. Upon returning, I noticed that the thermostat was turned down, but really no solution to this problem during the entire weekend. The next morning, it was very nice to sit in the court area of the lobby with their complimentary coffee. And I was able to choose from five morning newspapers on their rack. (Sipping my coffee and reading the Financial Times in the Windsor Court that morning made me think that I actually had money! And then I came to.)A couple of other negatives. The toliet did not work well, and generally required two/three flushes. The television is in a box and can be rotated for viewing from bedroom or living room, but it is clunky and needs to be replaced by a flat TV. Another reviewer talked about the lack of ice on each floor and yes, it was irritating. I had expected to pay for Internet, but it was complimentary. A terrific gin and tonic in the Polo Bar. The Windsor Court is in a very good location. Next September, check the prices at this hotel. My price was about 70% less than their normal rate. Classy place.
