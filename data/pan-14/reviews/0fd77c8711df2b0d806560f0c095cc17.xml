We were there for a week this June and found it to be a perfect location to see all the sights. We took cabs to the museums from the hotel and never paid more than $13 for the trip (with two per day, that comes to the same price as parking a car at the hotel). The included breakfast every morning is tasty and extensive and my son loved the managers reception every evening for snacks. I also can't say enough positive things about the staff. They were friendly and helpful with directions, flagging down cabs, and keeping the rooms and the grounds clean. The biggest downside to our stay is that we appeared to be there during school field trip season, so there were large swarms of somewhat unsupervised kids using the public areas. While this is a downside, it is certainly not the fault of the hotel. The Itallian restaurant in the hotel was very good, and there are a number of other restaurant options in easy walking distance of the hotel, through nice neighborhoods, including a number of embassies. Tip for tired sightseers - there are several local restaurants that will deliver to your room! We stretched a tasty Thai dinner out for two days. SInce the rooms are equiped with microwave and refridgerator, eating in the room is a reasonable option as well.
