Took a cab from The France train station but driver couldn't locate hotel, had to ask someone. Arrived around 5 p.m. and room on requested floor still wasn't ready. We waited for :45 minutes, room finally was prepared but on a different than requested floor, no reason given. NO cava was offered! Hotel was being worked on and the noise from the jack hammer was almost unberable. Internet was of a dial up nature and slower than mollases! Room was nice and the pool fine also. Breakfast very expensive even by European standards so we went elsewhere to eat. There were NO places to eat or shop around the hotel, the sea was about a :15 minute walk and the beach area was VERY pleasant, we had a wonderful dinner there out on the pier for a fair rate. I might consider staying here again but only after dong more research for something more coordinated.
