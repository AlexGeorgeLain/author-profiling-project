The clever linking of rows of traditional canalside houses into one hotel makes this more like a boutique property than a hotel owned by a multinational.. I can imagine that no two rooms could be the same. Certainly, mine was unique, off a landing with only two rooms, in the attic of one of the houses. Sloping ceiling right to the roof truss, gave the room a dramatic feel, and the fittings lived up to the room; polished oak floor, huge bed, flat screen television and a beautiful bathroom with power and hand showers.The dining area is broken into different rooms so that you are not staring across acres of space, and the buffet breakfast was superb, whether continental, Dutch or hot. (I recommend the Pancakes (crepes) with crispy bacon and mushrooms.)I found that the hotel fully lived up to everything I would expect of a luxury hotel, with the addition of unobtrusive good service, charm and character.
