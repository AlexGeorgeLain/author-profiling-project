It's an ideal place to stay for a few days. The hotel has undergone a complete refurbishment. Our room on the first was immacualate, well fitted and well equipped. The breakfast room is delightful. it sits in the courtyard of the hotel with a glass atrium overhead and a glass elevator to the upper floors sited in one corner. The hotel is about 3/400 yards from the station and all the main sights are walkable. We paid for 3 nights(mon,tues,wed) and including a good continental breakfast table. Great value for money, highly reccommended.
