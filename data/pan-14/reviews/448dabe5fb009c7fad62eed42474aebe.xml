Knowing this, it is fair to say that the Mosser hotel is good value for money as the rooms are spotless, wel designed and modern. There is also a big ceiling fan (varriable speed) which is really handy to circulate the air in this tiny room! Its location is also very central: litterally 3 seconds walk from the main street with trams to the piers and the Powell line going over the hills! My brother-in-law recommended this hotel and already told us that the rooms were really small, so we knew what to expect. We prefered the shared toilet/bathroom option to save a bit of money, and thought it was a good option as we never met anyone in the corridors and the toilets/bathrooms were really clean and always free! So, in summary, if you don't want backpackers style hotels but don't want to splash out either, I would recommend the Mosser.The only downside, was that we had view onto the back of the hotel where some contruction/building work were going on. Not best for the noise, but that's more bad luck/timing than the hotels fault itself.
