I don't know why anyone can complain about this Hotel, the staff were absolutely wonderful, extremely friendly and with emailing the Hotel before hand got the exact room I requested. The checkin was painless we drunk champayne while we were given our keys etc and then taken to our room by golf cart. We did not go Royal Service as we have always found everything to be first rate anyway. The room was the nearest to the beach, infact the view from our terrace was the beach. The room was spotlessly clean with clean towels everyday. Booking the many restaurants each day was no problem, we booked them from our room around 5pm each day. My favourite ones were the American Grill and the Mexican. Did not think the Japanese was that good and the French ones did not like at all. Overall I found the food very good and could always find something I liked. Why do people think this Hotel is too big?. When I go on vacation to Europe I do not go to one bar each night or one restaurant, I have a walk round and visit several. All I can think is these people do not like to walk.and prefer to stay in one place for the duration of their vacation.Having spent 15 or more vacations in Dom Rep I can certainly recommend this Hotel. I think its one of the best.

After staying in DR 10 times I would rate this the best and Casa Marina Reef the worst.CHECK IN10 mins to check in but 1 hour to receive baggage in our room. Did not bribe anyone(as someone mentioned) but was allocated the best room location. This was nearest to the beach with an ocean view on the Caribe side. The Royal Service Clents had to wait by the bus stop for transport to their rooms when we had only to walk a few yards.BEACHThe beach is beautiful. Some people stated that the seaweed was not cleared away. If you get up early you can see bags full of seaweed being removed every day. Unfortunately the seaweed came back within a short space of time.POOLPools are the biggest I have ever seen. The Caribe pool was more for relaxing. We timed how long it took to walk round it, 7 mins. Tropical pool was more for the children with games etc.FOODThe buffet restaurants for Breakfast and lunch are very good, what you would expect on all inclusive. The speciality restaurants are excellent if you like fairly rich food. My favourites were the American Grill and Los Dos which is the one outside next to the Avenue Bar. For smokers this is the only restaurant which you are allowed to smoke in(quite right too).BARSA must is the Avenue Bar on Wednesdays and Fridays. These are party nights. Had a great time even though had a bad headache the next day. The Bar staff here are the best. Did not need to order drinks they just appeared before I had finished the last one. Try the Chocolate martini - lovely.RoomsThe room I had was very comfortable. Coffee maker, Iron and Ironing board, Scales, hairdryer and fridge with drinks.The maid came in every day and left it immaculate.GOLFThis is definately the Hotel to stay in for free golf. You only had to pay for the buggy. It was very well organised for transport and tee times. The course was excellent but not easy.Overall I can understand people finding the Hotel too large but as we were very lucky and got a room near to pool and beach we only had to walk at night for the restauants and bars. This takes approx 10-15 mins. I didn't bother with the train even when it rained which was often in the first week. As for people saying don't wear high heel shoes, I did and found it easy to walk, no problem at all. The only criticism I would make is that there is not a beach bar so its a long walk for a drink. This did not affect us as it was so near to our room we got our drinks from there and used the insulated mugs.If I can organise another holiday this year I would certainly go again.
