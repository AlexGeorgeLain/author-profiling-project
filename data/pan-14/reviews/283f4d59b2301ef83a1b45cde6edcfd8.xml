We had a room with a city view which was very comfortable. The staff were helpful and check-in was easy. The location is very good, within walking distance to shopping and Pike Market. There is a very nice grocery store across the road which is open till 2am and sells everything, even Australian wine. We ate one night in the hotel restaurant. Enjoyable meal. Would definitely stay at the Warwick again

At first we were a little disappointed that we weren't right in the heart of the French Quarter but after our first walk through there at night we were glad we were just out of it as it is a very noisy area. It is only a couple of blocks of safe walking, even at night. The hotel itself is charming and very good value for money. Our room was huge and very comfortable. Two friends travelling with us thought they had booked a room with two beds but they were given a double bed. A request for two beds was met with no fuss. The concierge was very helpful in helping to arrange an alligator tour. The breakfast, included in the price is very good and there is a guest laundry which we found useful. There is also free internet access. In all a very nice hotel which I would have no hesitation is recommending.
