We were surprised how much we liked Venice ( especially compared to Rome) We booked based on prior trip advisor reviews though it was not easy to get a reservation! I was booked elsewhere and kept checking the hotel website and switched as soon as I nabbed a room. We loved the location - quiet, but not too far to walk to the major sights. We also loved the area restaurants that the hotel recommended especially Il refolo and La Zucca. We would not hesitate to recommend this to our friends and would stay here if ( when, hopefully)we return to Venice!
