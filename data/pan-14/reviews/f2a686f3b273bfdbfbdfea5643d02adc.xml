Although the rooms are small, the price is right, the rooms are clean, the water is hot, the breakfast is delicious, and the staff is awesome. The staff really went out of its way to help us with bus routes, directions, suggestions, etc. They never let us waste money on a cab, but rather showed us the easiest and cheapest way to get places. Breakfast is wonderful, just watch out for other pushy guests!
