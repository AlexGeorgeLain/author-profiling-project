Booked in June after reading trip advisor recommemndations and was not disappointed. We booked a 1 bedroomed apartment, but were given 2 bedrooms when we arrived. The rooms were huge, spotlessly clean and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Yes, the air con was noisy but luckily September isn't a bad month to go and we didn't need it on during the night. The rooms are a bit tired and I think double glazing would be a good idea as it is tdefinitely he city that never sleeps. The fridge was always re-stocked for the following morning and we found it a definite plus not to have to go out for breakfast - much more relaxed and there was always plenty to eat. Yes, there was work going on in reception but we never found it a problem as there is a temporary reception on the second floor. We were on the 4th and never heard any noise from the builders. And you couldn't fault the position. We were able to walk to central park, broadway, empire state, etc and the tube was only 1 block away - although found it very confusing! And if you wanted a taxi it only cost 5 dollars to get to Times Square but to be quite honest it was quicker walking! Leave yourself plenty of time to get back to the airport as the traffic is horrendous. May be it was because there was a VIP conference on at the Waldorff (just around the corner from the Hospitality Suites) and the roads were blocked off and police presence was huge. It took is 1 1/2 hrs to get to Newark!If you can, do the helicopter flight it was amazing and well worth the money. Wear comfy shoes as you won't believe how far you walk! Loved the shops, especially Bloomingdales and China Town is definitely worth a visit.
