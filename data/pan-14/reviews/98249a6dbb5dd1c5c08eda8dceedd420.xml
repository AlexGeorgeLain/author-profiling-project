The staff was very friendly and even upgraded my room b/c it was my birthday. The room is a basic room and great if you are in and out. Don't plan on some exotic getaway, but worked great for my husband and myself who cared more about spending money on the sites, than on a room we spent only sleeping in. Good location, too!
