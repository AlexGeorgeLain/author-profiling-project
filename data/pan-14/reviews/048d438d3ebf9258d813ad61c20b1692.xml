We liked the location because the hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the Green Street tube stop. There too much around the hotel but if you walk a few blocks run into tons of things. We walked very easily to Piccadilly Circus everyday. So the location was fabulous. We had access but none of the fuss! Our room was very nice as well. It was very, very clean. Housekeeping does a great job. I liked the bathrooms too. Both were just the right size for my husband and I. The staff were very nice as well. They fall over themselves trying to help you. It rained out while we were there and they were always ready with an umbrella or a taxi. We eat in the restaurant; it seemed expensive. We had a few drinks and a dessert in the bar and it converted to almost $50 US. There are two pubs a block away that were fantastic Lion and the Punch Bowl. The hotel was lovely; return, if only for the location. One plus left (by accident) some money out on the dresser. It was there when we returned. highly recommend this hotel!
