Taking advantage of some Hilton HHonors points I had stashed away, we ended up paying only for parking for our one-night stay. Our room on the top floor was surprisingly large and featured an amazing view of the downtown skyline to the southeast. At the Hilton Fisherman's Wharf it's all about location. Nestled in the heart of San Francisco's tourist district, the Hilton is a great choice for those looking to take in the sights and sounds of the city. Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square, Lombard Street and the cable car turnaround are all just a few blocks away. Chinatown, downtown, ATT Park and other attractions are a bit further and can easily be reached via trolley, cable car or taxi. Location comes at a price though as most hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf district carry a pricey nightly rate. Add on parking ($32 per day at the Hilton) and your costs for a visit to one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. will add up fast if you don't plan well in advance.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Questions about the surrounding area including directions and transportation options were easily and happily answered by members of the Hilton team. The front desk was short-staffed at check-in though with only one agent processing check-ins and answering phones with a line of four groups waiting to be helped. I'd definitely stay at the Hilton Fisherman's Wharf again if in the area, especially if I had additional HHonors points to spare. Our one-night experience was pleasant and you couldn't ask for a better location in the Fisherman's Wharf area.
