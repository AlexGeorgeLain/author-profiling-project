The rooms are light and airy, the beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are spotless and modern. It's in the museum district, a short tram ride to the city centre and a five minute walk to the major museums. Ask for a room in the back, which is exceptionally quiet. It is very reasonable and I highly recommend it.
