My daughter and I easily walked from the train station to the hotel, with excellent directions from Mr. Lombardi. The hotel is walkably close to the Duomo, markets, museums, and restaurants. Our hosts also made our reservations at the Accademia and the Uffizi, so we have to wait long in line. Our room was spacious and clean with crisp white linens and comfortable beds. We enjoyed the ample breakfast fare with local pastries, the wonderful coffee, and the helpful library of travel books and maps. A pleasant, gracious staff made us feel like family. Many of our fellow-guests shared our favorable opinion of Hotel Casci. I would definitely stay there again. The only downside was that our room could have used a little more heat, since November nights can be a little chilly.
