We stayed in this hotel in and had a fantastic holiday.I upgraded our holiday from a garden room to a beach room before we arrive as a surprise for my partner, but when we arrived we found that been upgraded again by the Hotel, to a beach front suite!! It was fantastic with spectacular views of the complex, beach and sea! The food, the staff, the view, the ask for more.If you can afford to upgrade to the executive rooms, well worth it. The extras you get as part of this package are excellent. The executive club was simply great. The staff welcome you at the door and do enough for you during your stay. a really personal service by really lovely people!We used all the facilities (including the spa) and enjoyed them all. There was some modernisation going on of some of the facilities, which is good to see. It means that the Hotel owners value updating what is a lovely hotel, keeping pace with competitors.I know the above is quite gushy, but believe me, I travel the world with my job and stay in top class 4 5 star hotels and this one is at the top of my list.My best wishes go to all the staff.Drew
