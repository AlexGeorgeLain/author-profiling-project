The hotel is well-placed for getting around in the city by any means, and we felt quite comfortable in the Union Square area. The corner room near the top of the hotel was superb, as was the housekeeping staff. Despite construction being present, the staff made efforts to not allow it to be an impediment to our 5 day stay. The consierge staff was mistaken on their suggestions/ directions a few times, and provided out-dated information. At this hotel, we were very near excellent restaurants, shopping, and transportation within blocks of the hotel. American Airlines lived up to its reputation for tarnishing an otherwise enjoyable vacation in a beautiful hotel with a great staff.
