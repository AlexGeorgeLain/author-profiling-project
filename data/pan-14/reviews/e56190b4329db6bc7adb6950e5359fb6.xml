Last December American Airlines had a $250 Austin/San Juan round trip special that we couldn't pass up and pushed the Buy button! I mentioned the cheap airfare and our friends (other retirees) said we're in. With a little research we decided to circumnavigate the island staying at paradors and sample the fine Porto Rican food and the rums. What a great idea! I booked our rooms via Expedia.com at $107+tax/room/night. This was our last night in Puerto Rico. This is a very nice boutique hotel, that has little parking - maybe room for 5 cars. Regardless, it is nice and where they got 2 1/2 stars is beyond me. Through some type of mixup they did not have our reservations and were going to put us in a different upgraded hotel. However, upon showing our paid receipt from Expedia and stating that we did not want to stay in a differenc hotel from our friends, they upgraded us to a room near the bar. It had a four poster bed, small but complete kitchen and a sitting area. Everything was well kept and clean. I like these small hotels and can definitely recommend staying at the Wind Chimes. It's also easy walking distance to the more active area of San Juan.This cheap trip ended up being cheap as far as airfare and hotel cost, but be assured that we made up and more of the savings on fine food and drink. A great spur-of-the-moment trip. The best part of Puerto Rico is away from San Juan and amongst the locals in the countryside.Larry Kelly
