Hotel is located in fancy neighbourhood next to Vondelpark with walking distance/ easy tram access to tourist areas. We chose the hotel, because it has a unique idea compared to hundreds of other similar, budget hotels and it was far enough from tourist trap areas with thousands of drunken English. The Hotel's idea is good enough to make it nice experience. Yes, rooms are small in this category, but that is something you can expect when travelling in Europe. You get what you pay for-and here you get something nice extra: unique idea. The personel was really friendly and helpful all the time. Rooms were little old, but ok. Like someone mentioned, the idea cover's well the oldness. We didn't have any problems with anything. Enough space in room with that sum of money, normally working bathroom etc. Even the breakfast was good enough. There are always the city taxes in Amsterdam and several other cities. Unfortunately some internet sites doesn't inform that. Hotel is maybe little far for walking several times a day to tourist areas, but there is easy access to everywhere in the city with trams (stop is 300m from Hotel) or even better is rent a bike! There are several companies in tourist areas and one is near hotel in Overtoom: the price is and it's really nice way see the city and much better than you are not interested in whores and drugs, this is really nice hotel for you far enough from red light dictrict. Instead there is short distance to REAL Amsterdam: Jordaan, De Pijp and many cultural sites.
