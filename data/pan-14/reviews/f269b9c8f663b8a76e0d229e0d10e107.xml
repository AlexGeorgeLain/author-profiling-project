This may have been due in part to the large group of alumni for a football game. But we were very frustrated.Breakfast service in the Kabby's sports bar was extremely slow. It was almost as though they were trying to make sure that we ordered the buffet the following day. (We did not.) Service in the evening was much faster despite being a lot busier. Prices seemed high to me.We also ate twice at Drago's seafood restaurant. My companion had chicken and pasta dishes both times. She said they were both good. One time, I had gumbo. I found it thin and super-salty. The next time, I had what I would call Thai oysters - coated in peanuts and red pepper. It was good. Service was good.
