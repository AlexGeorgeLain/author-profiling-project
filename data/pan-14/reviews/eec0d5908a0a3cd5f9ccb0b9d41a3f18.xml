This hotel is at the top of La Rambla , right next to Universidad metro stop and a few minutes from Catalunya metro stop. It's less than a minute to La Rambla and althoguh it's on a busy street, it's not a problem. A recurring theme seems to be the TV and coffee machines being out of order, maybe they never worked! But it would be better to remove them from the room completely if this is the case. The hotel is very clean, modern and has a top breakfast down in the basement! We loved our stay here, the room and hotel overall were quite small but not inconveniently so. I would defeinitely recommend, and I can't believe what great value for money this is. Also....we arrived late and wanted to find somewhere for dinner near by and that were still serving! One of the first buildings on La Rambla that you'll come to is a cafe downstairs but just above is Bacco (you'll see the name on the window, it's next to Burger King unfortunately!). It was really cheap, lovely food (starters were stunning, main course nice but nothing fancy). And we had a view over La Rambla and Place de Catalunya.

It's a gorgeous hotel, the rooms are tiny but that's Paris! The staff were lovely and the bar was more like being in someone's (very posh) living room. Beautiful place, very swanky but didn't feel we had to put on our airs and graces at all! No pretence just gorgeousness!Plus we got three nights for the price of two!
