Our choice was based almost entirely on the reviews we read here on Trip Advisor. The rave reviews we read here seemed almost too good to be true and you know what they say about something that sounds too good to be true. This hotel most certainly did NOT deserve all the 5.0 ratings it got here. Yes, the location is excellent, just a half block from the beach and shopping area and right next door to an ABC store. If I were rating this hotel based solely on location I would give it a 5. However, there is more to a hotel than location. The rooms were old and badly in need of refurbishment. For example, the wallpaper in our bathroom was peeling from the walls. Our ocean view room was small and dated, but the view was fantastic. Don't even factor the so-called continental breakfast into your decision on whether to stay here or not because you will almost certainly end up at the Starbucks about a block away. The breakfast consisted of coffee (no decaf), hot tea, juice, mass produced danishes and toast. I did not experience any of the legendary outstanding service spoken about so often in the Trip Advisor reviews. Yes, the staff was nice, but nothing outstanding. All in all we were OK with the choice we made, but mainly because we were leaving on a fabulous cruise in a couple of days. If I had booked this hotel for the entire vacation, I would have been very disappointed.
