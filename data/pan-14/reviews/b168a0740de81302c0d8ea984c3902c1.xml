I am so happy that I didn't take advice from the other reviews about this hotel...I had a wonderful time there...Upon arrival my bags were brought up to my room immediately...I was upgraded to an ocean view room #1213 and the view was beautiful...I called for a coffee maker and that was brought up in a matter of minutes...My room was cleaned daily and fresh towels, shampoo and soap was replaced without asking!!! The pool was not crowded, but I prefer the ocean and it was right across the street...A car was not needed because everything imaginable was within walking distant...The Tiki Restaurant was great!!! Fast service and pleasant wait staff...The room was decorated in a kind of Retro fashion, not for me but very clean and cute!!!The Honolulu Zoo was within walking distant as was the Aquarium...Places to eat and shopping were also close... In the evening you can sit on the lanai and listen to the bands they have there nightly...I truly found nothing wrong with this hotel and will stay there again when I return to Honolulu!!!

It faced the canal...The room was clean and the bed was comforable...The staff was very pleasant and helpful in giving directions and suggesting restauarants...I enjoyed the pool and also the area around the pool if you prefer a more peaceful and private place to get some sun...The lanai is great as far as having coffee or a meal, totally private...I am a woman and I travel alone, I felt very safe both in the hotel area and the surrounding streets...Plenty of police patroling both in cruisers and on foot.. There is a great bakery, that I visited often...Walk out the main lobby, make a left, walk to the first intersection, cross the street and make another left it is on the right hand side of the street (Saint-German Bakery)...Seaside Bar and Grill has a great breakfast and many dinner specials...(Cheap) I also took a morning Catamaran sail on the Makani, it is a brand new boat and the crew was just great!!!You might also like to visit Sea Life Park, I really enjoyed myself there, Dolphins, sea lions and many other sea animals...I even swam with the dolphins, the highlight of my trip..I would certainly stay at The Colony my next trip!!!If your looking for luxury, this isn't the hotel for you, but if your on a budget, most definetly stay here....
