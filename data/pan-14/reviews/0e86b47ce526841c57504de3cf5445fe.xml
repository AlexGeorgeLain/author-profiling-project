My wife and I live in the Florida Keys and we find it convenient to spend the night in Miami when we are attending a sporting event or concert.The Hyatt is perfectly located in downtown Miami right on the Miami River where the river empties into Biscayne Bay. If you are in Miami for business or pleasure and need to have access to the downtown area and government centers this hotel is for you.The Knight Center (a convention center and concert venue) is located in the same building as the Hyatt. Miami's Metro-Mover, a clean and modern public transportation system which takes you to all the major government centers, sport and concert venues in downtown Miami has a station adjoining the Hyatt.The rooms are recently refurbished, spacious, modern and clean. Many of the rooms have views of the Miami River or Biscayne Bay. This hotel has all the services and amenities you would expect in a 4 star business hotel and deserves all 4 stars.
