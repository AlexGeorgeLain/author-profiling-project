The Barbizon is located very close to the station and the old town and has a bit of character about it. Many of the hotels in Amsterdam don't alas. The rooms are bigger than others I have stayed at in other Amsterdam hotels and the service is generally pretty good. This is a solid choice for business or leisure when staying in Amsterdam.

We were not disappointed. The interior of the hotel is distinct as are the rooms and it was a refreshing change fromt same old same old of the traditional US chain hotel in this price bracket (Marriot, Hilton, etc).Service was generally good although for some reason check in is not until 4 in the afternoon and we were not able to check in until dead on 4 as the hotel was full. The location was pretty good, just off the interstate and in a nice part of town and not too far from downtown, the malls etc.Being English I never like the valet parking only idea. I much prefer the option of parking my own car but that was only a little niggle. The only other niggle was the what we thought general poor quality of the cocktails in the bar considering their price.Overall though a pleasant and good hotel and if I ever happened to be in Dallas again I would probably stay here again.
