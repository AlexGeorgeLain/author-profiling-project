Check in was efficient and the desk people very accomodating and friendly. Our room was spotless, we had more towels than we could use, every evening the maid would check to see if we needed more. The food was good, not terrific, but good, and the French restaurant was excellent. We found the resort very clean, the bathrooms by the beach were always very clean and that is hard to maintain. The staff were extremely friendly. They had the best aquasize classes i have ever had at a resort. The pool was wonderful, the best feature of the resort. I would say that the only thing at the resort which was not as good as the Bavarro side was the ocean, it was quite rough, and there was a lot of coral in the sand, Actually, they had to close the beach down at the end of our time there. I would highly recommend this resort for families with children, and older travellers, actually anyone
