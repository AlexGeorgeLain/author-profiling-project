My boyfriend and I stayed in the suites from October 8 through the October 10.I thought the suite was fabulous. We had our own kitchen and garden, and the place was spacious and clean. It was very welcoming after a long day of walking and sightseeing - seemed like coming home to our own studio apartment!The location is great... Chelsea is in lower Manhattan, close to all the places we wanted to go. The subway is three blocks away from Chelsea Lodge, which is very convenient. The neighborhood is quiet and has lots of restaurants and shops nearby.I would definitely recommend Chelsea Lodge due to the nice staff (they allowed us to leave our luggage after check out to give us more time in the city), the location, and cleanliness.
