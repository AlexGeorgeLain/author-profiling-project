I did not have a choice as to where to stay as I was traveling with an organization. The hotel is convenient to Seattle International Airport, and is about a 3 minute ride from the baggage claim.The rooms were typical Holiday Inn hotels with some signs of aging. Nevertheless, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms are a bit small, but were sufficient.The pool area and gym was better than many other Holiday Inns, and was even open 24 hours.I did not go to the bar, but as part of the group, I did partake in the breakfast buffet every morning. The buffet had the typical selections found at most hotel breakfasts, but the food here actually tasted quite good and different from other hotels.All in all, an OK choice for an overnight, but I would not recommend this property for stays more than a night or two. I would like to praise the hotel staff, though, on being very friendly , and accommodating requests.For good food within walking distance, I recommend Thirteen Coins, an upscale bar and restaurant open 24 hours.
