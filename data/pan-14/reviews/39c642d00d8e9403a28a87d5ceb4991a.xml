We had booked on a budget and it was our first time to Hong Kong.The staff were reasonable, not overfriendly but not discourteous. The rooms were small but I liked them because of this, it gave a cosy contrast to Hong cold damp spring weather.The positioning of the hotel could have been better, we used the underground system for the duration of our stay and it was a good ten-minute walk to the nearest station. also handy that the structure is so noticeable, especially when we attempted to find our way home at night after a couple of drinks...Moral of the review, if your young and adventurous and the hotel you stay in going to make nor break your trip then this is a good mid range choice.
