I needed to find a hotel for a one night stay in Miami and decided to give this hotel a try. It was more expensive then some of the other hotels I considered, so I was expected much more then what I got. The check-in process went okay, until I discovered that the request I made had not been met. I realize when making reservations, requests can not be guaranteed, but when I asked, he looked at me like he had no clue what I was talking about. He then started scanned his screen, so I got the impression that my request hadn't been fulfilled because he hadn't bother to read it. I then asked if the room had a microwave. He checked and then told me it didn't. So, I go up to the room, and discover that the room did have a microwave! Great! Until I discovered it didn't work. The room also didn't have a fridge. I purposely booked a room that listed a fridge. So I was disappointed. Called the front desk. To bad, nothing they can do. The next morning, I went to ask the front desk a question, but the clerk was too busy watching television (I think) and ignored me for about a full minute. All the employees I encountered during my stay were neither friendly, or helpful.The room itself was nicely decorated. A few stains, but nothing really bad. Although there was strong smell, clorox like. The pool was well kept, and there was a nice variety for breakfast.Overall, the room okay, the service terrible.
