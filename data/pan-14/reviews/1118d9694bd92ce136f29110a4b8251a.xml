The room was going for around $150 plus tax on the hotel site and elsewhere.First off, the lobby is nice, it was recently re-done and the outside of the building. It's now white and not brownish looking (I wish I took some pix to post)Checked in at 9pm (flight came in late), 20 minutes waiting in line, got a room, and when I opened the door it was a mess! It seemed like it was someones room and I left and went downstairs and complained. They waived the parking fee as a goodwill gesture (which I didn't even ask for). They said the room said it was cleaned and no one is in there and said sorry about that. So they gave me another room. Room was ok. It was dated for sure, looked late 80's/early 90's. The bed was ok. The bathroom had a jetted tub which was nice.So I finished putting my bags away, and parked the car. $10 for self parking, that's fine with me. I hate valet and waiting for them to bring the car so I didn't choose that. The walk was about 5 minutes across the street which didn't bother me at all, however I wish they gave better directions/signage it was confusing and annoying. The pool/hot tub is decent, the beach area is nice. I would rate this a 3* hotel, and i'm sure in time the rooms will be updated as the outside/lobby were recently done and that would improve the hotel but I don't think I would stay here again after my experience.
