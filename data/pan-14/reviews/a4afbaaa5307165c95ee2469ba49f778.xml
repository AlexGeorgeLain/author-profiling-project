The room we reserve wasn't available. So they transfered us to a villa. What supposed to be un upgrande it was a downgrade, II guess!!The air condition breaks every day. There are roaches everywere, the sidewalk to the villa was slippery....The location is good. Very close (walking distance) to the main shops and restaurants of kuta (if you could get to the destination without being disturbed by taxi cabs, salesmen etc....)We spent 4 days here and move to a resort in Nusa Dua. Weshoud have done this since the begining...If you are not teenager, surfist or anything like that go to another place....
