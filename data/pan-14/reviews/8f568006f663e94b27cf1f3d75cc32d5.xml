While I found the location to be perfect and the staff super friendly, the rooms are tiny (which I know is par for the course in Europe) and the beds were so uncomfortable - the sheets are like sandpaper. We had 2 separate stays while in town and the first half we were upgraded to the suite. I'm not sure how much that normally costs, but it was a good sized room with a nice view and a balcony. The stairs are rather daunting, around 75 total to the 4th floor, but it was our daily exercise. The second stay was in a room that was really small and almost had no place for 2 people to put their luggage, and we traveled lightly. The rooms were both clean and each came with a fridge, and coffee/tea maker, which was nice. The staff was always helpful. I can't comment on breakfast since we wanted to enjoy those delicious Dutch pancakes in town.If I didn't have to sleep in those beds again, I would recommend the Nadia. Again, the location can't be beat.
