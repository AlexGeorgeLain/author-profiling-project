The free breakfast was simple but pretty good and rotated throughout the week. The view from the restaurant was excellent, and I really enjoyed waking up to a cup of coffee while watching the surfers catch the 4-5 ft. waves directly in front of the hotel. The rooms were very large for the price and had a full suite of amenities. The bathroom was a little rusty but still quite adequate. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, and helped out with any possible request. The only real problem I had with the hotel was the booking. I booked through their website, gave them my credit card info, and received a confirmation...then on my day of travel they abruptly canceled my reservation. I didn't find out until I was at the hotel. The hotel was very accommodating though, and gave me a room for around the same price as the internet special I wanted (~550000 Rp) despite not having a reservation when I showed up.
