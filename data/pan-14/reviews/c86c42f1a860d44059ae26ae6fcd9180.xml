Room was more like a suite with a view over the harbour. Breakfast was about extra each but well worth it. Tram and bus stops right outside. Plenty of restaurants full of locals within 2/3 minutes. At only a night per room it was a real bargain..

Forget the hotel breakfasts though, part of the fun was eating with the locals in nearby delis and diners.
