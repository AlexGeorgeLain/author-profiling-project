I had booked deluxe accomodations through the BestWestern site, hoping for a large room. However, when we arrived, nothing matching our requirements (twin beds) was available, so we were put into an attractive, recently redecorated, but very modestly sized room. Also, the hotel web site had indicated a coffee maker and AM-FM radio in each room. Neither was available. When I asked for a radio, the clerk suggeted that I go out and buy one! One more negative, there was no free Internet access in the hotel for guests who didn't own a laptop. Fortunately, an internet cafe in the ZAHARA cafe right across the street was conveniently located. Some of the desk staff were friendly and helpful, some not. when we checked out, the staff person let us know that he thought that we had been charged deluxe prices without deluxe accommodations. But he still didn't give us a reduction in the price! Now for the positive: The bathroom was marble, shiny, and spotlessly clean, as was the room. The noise from the street on the front of the hotel is very loud, but the insulated windows block out virtually all noise. We slept with the windows closed and the AC on ( very quiet), and it was a good solution. The ninth-floor lounge is sensational--very large with many comfortable seating areas . Free tea and coffee. I treated this as my living room, and it was an excellent way to expand the modest space of our room. Finally, the location is terrific. Walking distance to many tourist destinations and very convenient to transportation--both metro and buses. For those who don't want to pay for the hotel breakfast, a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts are across the street. And the Cortes Ingles department store across the way has a large and well-stocked grocery store on its lower level. Overall, this is a fine hotel, but I came away less than satisfied with the service and amenities.
