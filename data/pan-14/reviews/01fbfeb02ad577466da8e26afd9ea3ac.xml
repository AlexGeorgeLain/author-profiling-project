Stefano and Suzanna are the most delightful, helpful hosts/owners. We arrived in the pouring rain and were immediately taken to our 6th floor apartment to enable us to dry out and relax. Stefano threw open the shutters to our terrace to reveal a view to the palace and campanile. The terrace is framed by pots and pots of miniature roses. Our apartment was spacious with fully equipped kitchen, living room, seperate bedroom and bathroom and was immaculately clean. The location - superb!!! The Bridge of Sighs is 10 metres away and St Marco square is a 2 minute walk - get up at dawn and stroll to the square to see it empty of crowds - breathtaking!
