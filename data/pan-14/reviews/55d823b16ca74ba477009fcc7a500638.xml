The room was clean and accomodating, the coffee maker and fridge make a difference. The room was small and the bed a little uncomfortable so it is best for a one or two night stay. The service was great, the front desk went online and printed me out directions to a restaurant I was asking about, it doesn't get much better than that. The parking lot was full the night we stayed b/c of a concert so we parked at a meter an put some quarters in at 8 and moved it by 10am. Saved the $12 so we weren't upset.Not a bad option (especially for a $100 price.)
