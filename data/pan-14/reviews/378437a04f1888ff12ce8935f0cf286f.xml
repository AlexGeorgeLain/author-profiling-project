I was allocated Room Five, a single room without loo etc, however there was a shower/loo beside my room which was fine.My room was small bijou: about 15' x 7' or thereabouts; tea/coffee facilities, a wardrobe, telly... everything necessary. And very clean too.I cannot speak highly enough about the breakfast: I enjoy a full breakfast so I opted for fruit juice, a cooked brekkie of two very lean rashers of Danish back bacon (no fat at all), one egg, beans and two slices of white, hot toast with butter and tea/coffee. Absolutely perfect. Couldn't wish for anything more.Very amiable staff and the proprietor who has relatives in Northern Ireland; so we had a good natter! They make you feel at home and are most helpful for advice about London, bookings etc.I really loved this place and hope to return again. If the staff read this, I wish to thank them from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. By the way, I do not usually give five stars for my reviews; however, given the value of this guesthouse, I feel it more than merits this.
