Stayed in the Ambassador Hotel in Barcelona, on a side street off The Ramblas. Hotel is situtated in a great location, the streets have so much to see with markets and entertainers lining them, u wont feel the 5min walk to the harbour. Temperatures were in high 20's but walking along the median of the ramblas which is lined with trees kept us cool.The hotel was lovely n clean and hotel staff were friendly. Room were large with large bed and mini fridge. Bathroom was also clean and large and lots of things provided, shampoo, showergel, toothpaste, even a sewing kit and shoe polishing kit!Will definetely be returning here again!!
