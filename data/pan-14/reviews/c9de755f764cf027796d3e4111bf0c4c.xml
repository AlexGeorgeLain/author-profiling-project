There were four elevators that got me up to the 8th floor in a matter of seconds. Also, the staff was very helpful: I called the front desk at around 3:30 AM for a packet of regular coffee and got it in about 3 minutes.Cons:The pillows, probably in an effort to be fashionable, were squares, and smaller than a standard pillow. They were quite comfortable, but only when my head was completely on it, which was a challenge. Also, the towels are similar to those you'd find at a Quality Inn or some other lower level hotel -- definitely not what I'd expect to see when paying over $200 a night.

And I'm sure people have gotten it for less before. Amazing deal at that price. At $500, I probably wouldn't have been as happy.I think the reviews about the World Trade Center construction are exaggerated. I had a room facing ground zero and was not disrupted at all. If I turned off the TV and the air conditioner, I was only barely able to hear construction, but not at all if anything in the room was on.The room had a 42 plasma TV which was nice, however there was no HD programming, which I find quite annoying. What's the purpose of having such a great TV if it has a crappy picture?The bath linens and bed were very comfortable. I would have liked a few more outlets, though.
