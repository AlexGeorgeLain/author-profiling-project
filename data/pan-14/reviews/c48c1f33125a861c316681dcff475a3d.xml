I just got back from 5 weeks in Europe. This place was actually one of our favorites. First of all, no, it isn't the best place to stay at. If you are traveling though, shouldn't you be out of your room exploring. We basically just used the place to sleep and bathe. The breakfast was decent compared to all other places we stayed at. It was as many bread rolls, meat, cheese, eggs, jam, coffee, oj, apple j as you wanted. There were no mice of any sorts throughout the place. The room we had booked was occupied so they ended up putting us on the very top room. It was great. Very roomy, beds were clean and comfy. We had a sink in the room and bathroom in the hall. The decorations weren't nice but who needs decorations in a hotel when you have a gorgeous city all around you. The people at the front desk were extremely nice and helful. Our friend got sick on our stay and the lady managed to get a doctor to come to us. This is a great place for younger adults or adults who don't plan on staying in their room the whole time.
