The hotel had only been open 6 months at this time so some taxi drivers didn't know where it was, but that should change. Although it's not central, for me the location in the Eixample district was fine: 10 minutes' walk from Sants station along Avenida de Roma, and two blocks from the nearest tube station. It's just two or three tube stops from the main tourist/dining areas of La Rambla/Placa de Catalunya/Passeig de Gracia/Diagonal etc.The hotel itself is very stylish and modern, with good facilities: sumptuous breakfast (but get in early if you want the hot stuff), air conditioned rooms, multi-channel flatscreen TV etc. Our room was a good size and had a large bathroom, and the decor was very 'cool'. Only complaint was that our room had a (locked) adjoining door with the next room (presumably for families) and there was some noise as a result.Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Amister. I don't know what prices are like as we were transferred there from another hotel which was overbooked.
