The hotel grounds are magnificent and we experienced excellent service all the way from the lobby to the waiters at the buffets. Other than one afternoon of rain, the weather was hot and we had blue skies. The sea was a little choppy and there are alot of rocks but it won't stop you from getting in. We originally stayed on the 3rd floor facing construction but after speaking to management for a better view, we were transfered to a room with a pool view. The rooms were nicely decorated with marble counters and a standing shower that could hold more than 2 people comfortably. The pool is huge and the best spot in it is near the walk up bar. Most of the action is right there also because the entertainment crew entertains right there. Quick shot out to JESUS (Mr. blablabla lol),Nina, Melvin, Masiel, Leo, Warter, Francisco, Ive and Pablo. They were great. They did a good job getting people involved and playing silly entertaining games. The best bartender we encountered was Roberto, located at the lobby bar. The Spa is out of this world. A must excursion for the trip.Restaurants were good not great. Don't go there expecting Ruth Chris and you will be fine. Overall I would say that I think that this hotel deserves its top 5 rank in popularity on Trip Advisor. Majestic is a great value when you add up the service, appearance, food and variety of entertainment.
