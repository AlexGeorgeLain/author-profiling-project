It was very small and quaint. It was wonderful, we found it in one of Rick Steves' books. If you want something a little different then for sure go for this!!! You'll love it. It is in walking distance to the train station and many restuarants etc. There was a nice breakfast each morning and the manager was there we were able to visit with her a little. LOVED IT!!!
