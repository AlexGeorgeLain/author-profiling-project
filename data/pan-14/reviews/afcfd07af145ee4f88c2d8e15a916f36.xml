Stayed seven nights for our family vacation, wife and I in an imperial room on the 22nd floor with a partial view of SoMa and south SF, and kids in a deluxe room on the 9th floor with a view of the buildings accross the street. The imperial room is more expensive but is roomier, has one of those neat TVs in the bathroom mirror, and stereo sound system. Also comes with the complimentary lounge which serves a continental breakfast in the morning, and wine and cheese in the evening. We also were provided with complimentary vouchers for the breakfast buffet. At the time of our stay, the hotel was switching over to wireless internet, which was included in our room rate, but $10/night for the deluxe room. We used the in-door pool, hot tub and exerise equipment regularly. Also were regulars at the Starbucks inside the hotel.Enjoyed the modern japanese decor and art.All types of transportation right outside the door, and as my wife and daughter may attest, the number of shopping opportunities between Union Square and the Westfield Center is mind boggling.All in all, a great home base for our vacation.
