It was an easy walk from the train station, even with our luggage, and a great location (the windows opened up to a very close view of the Duomo). It was an easy walk to everything in Florence. The room was spacious and attractive, and the breakfast OK. It was noisy outside, even at night (just shut the windows for quiet). There was an computer in the lobby you could pay to use for email, etc.
