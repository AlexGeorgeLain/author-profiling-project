Food was sub-par and overpriced. Room service was never delivered. Bath amenities cheap and flourescent lighting in the hallways!!!!!Staff didn't answer phone calls. Service was non-existent. If you have high standards and expectations, don't settle for this property stay at the Dylan.Truly a foul and overpriced experience. Never again.
