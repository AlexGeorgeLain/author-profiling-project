It was amazing, the location was in the downtown area, there was a very chic cafe nearby and restaurant (Segofreddo and Novecento). Publix is walking distance (all item supermarket and pharmacy). Anyways the hotel was super clean, the staff comes to your room twice daily to clean up and shape up your room. The bathroom is HUGE. Very modern, amazing bath products from London, close up mirror (lighted), extra towels, robes, slippers, etc.The room was VERY roomy (i had a 2 double beds), with windows facing the water. Swimming pool is very cool, great hip music playing on speakers, ideal for families or singles, or business travelers. Fresh fruit passes you by in a bowl on hot days complimentary, lemon water, etc. Tennis courts below. Theyve thought of everything at this hotel. 25th floor lobby has an amazing outdoor little bar area overlooking the view also very cool at night for a pre-drink.Would definitely stay here again. South Beach is not too far 10 min cab ride. Brickell area really nice and nice crowd as well.Two thumbs up!
