It was the perfect place to crash after being out all day. We had a room on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel and so didnt hear the traffic outside at all. The staff are really helpful and very friendly. Yes the rooms are small and we had up graded to a superior room after reading the reviews on trip advisor and i am glad that we did. The room was still not big at all but was enough space for the 2 of us for 5 days. New York is great and i would definately stay at Hotel 41 again as the location in perfect!!!!
