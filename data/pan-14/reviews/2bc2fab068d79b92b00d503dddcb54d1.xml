Room was exceptionally clean and we appreciated the turndown service which provided bottled water and slippers. All the upgraded amenities were a nice touch. I agree that the walls are slightly thin. However, no poblem sleeping in the comfortable beds.This hotel was about a $20 cab ride from South Beach and Key Biscayne. Breakfast at Atrio was amazing, dinner was just average.
