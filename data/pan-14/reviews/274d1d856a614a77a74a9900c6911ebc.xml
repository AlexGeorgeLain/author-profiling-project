We were pleasantly surprised. We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and had the staff open the door between as our daughters were next door. Nicely decorated, excellent staff, and very comfortable atmosphere. Matresses could have been better but they were bearable. The weather was cool and the room heating was nice. Again, the lobby and staff were just so pleasant. I definitely recommend this hotel. Also, we enjoy walking and had a nice walk to Union Square, China Town, and other surrounding areas. The staff made good recommendations on areas to visit and to avoid. Parking is tough but we utilized the parking directly across the street. Pricey but again... it is San Francisco and you must expect that.
