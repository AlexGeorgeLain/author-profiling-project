The Hotel staff are really nice and couldn't be more helpful. Breakfast is a bit expensive but there is plenty of it. The Hotel is apparently undergoing some renovation at the moment and some of the rooms could do with it. Having said that although the carpet in our room was a bit shabby the room was clean and the bed linen all seemed new. The second time we stayed we had a room with a balcony which was a bit more expensive but seemed to have been one of the upgraded ones and was really nice. The situation of the hotel was perfect. Five minute walk to Darling Harbour and ten minutes to Circular Quay. For us it couldn't have been better. The Hotel also has a bar and the restaurant does evening meals which we also sampled and could recommend.The price is reasonable and you get good value for money. I would definitely stay here again.
