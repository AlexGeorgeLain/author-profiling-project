After a week of staying in motels the small sized room in the Mosser was initially a bit of a shock. However, the hotel had provided everything we needed including a welcome pack, good value laundry and TV. We had shared bathroom facilities, but these were clean and we never had to wait to use them. All the staff were very friendly and helpful,and the hotel had a nice feel to it. The hotel is perfectly situated down town, within walking distance of all the shops, cable cars and the coast. I would highly recommend it.
