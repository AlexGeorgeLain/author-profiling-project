		<document id="402cbe6b4dd465275fa1579aa73dc37a" url=""><![CDATA[Enjoyed our stay there Stayed for 4 nights. We had to take 2 rooms since they didn't have a vacant family room. The rooms are plesant and clean, quite small though. The stuff was friendly and helpful - could tell us everything we needed about public transportation, opening hours etc'. The breakfast free buffet was really excellent - reach and tasty, with a variety of food and beverages.Unlike in the States, in Europe they charge for internet access (13 Euro per day) which is pretty annoying. Also, in the bath room there are soap / shampoo (together!) dispensers, instead of regular packs. I didn't like it, but it is really negligible.The location is very good, in walking distance to shopping area, restorants and bars. There are subway stations near by, and major bus lines as well. We paid aprox. 100 Euro per night per room (for two).
