We booked a King Suite which had 2 seperate rooms - 1 bedroom and 1 living room area. The living room area was quite small and had 2 chairs (no couch) to watch TV with - we never used this room. We found that we were so busy taking in the sights of the beautiful city that all we needed was the bedroom. The room was beautifully decorated and we must agree with all of the other reviews that the breakfast was a huge bonus (as well good). We joked about who would make breakfast for us in the mornings when we returned home. I loved the chocolate chip cookies at night - in fact when we were out for dinner I had no need to order dessert knowing that back at our gem of a hotel there was tea and cookies waiting.The staff were friendly and helpful and well it is true that we looked out a brick wall - we were also looking at beautiful plants that had planted along the ledge of the exterior wall.We would definitely return to this hotel.
