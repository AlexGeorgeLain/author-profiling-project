Super location for transport with the MTR, buses and trams to take you around the city just a few hundred yards away. Buses to Stanley and Aberdeen etc are also just up the road from the tram stop.We had a harbour view room which was fairly small as compared to other hotels that we stayed in Asia - but that is to be expected given that space is a premium in HK.Rooms are very comfortable, with comfy bed and nice bathroom and safe deposit box and tea/coffee facilities at no charge, staff were very friendy.Will stay again.
