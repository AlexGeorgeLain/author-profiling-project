Reception staff were friendly and speeded us through so that we were in our room within 10 minutes - great view straight across Bayside Marketplace and Bayfront Park.Room was clean and considering the location much larger than we were expecting - one king bed with the remaining space taken up by sofa, table, chairs etc where another king bed could have gone!Restaurant is OK... dinner menu is quite limited and one or two strange combinations but the food was good (we really didn't fancy venturing out on the first night after a 9 hour flight). Breakfast is typical Holiday Inn, either served as a buffet (weekends I think) and regular HI breakfast menu the rest of the time.All in all an enjoyable place to stay in downtown ideally placed for shopping and people watching at Bayside - and don't forget the boat tours of Millionaire's Row available directly opposite. The Hotel is also only minutes from the cruise terminals of the Port of Miami, and around 20 minutes from the airport (plenty of roadworks and building going on while we were there), and just a short distance to the new Carnival Center for Performing Arts.
