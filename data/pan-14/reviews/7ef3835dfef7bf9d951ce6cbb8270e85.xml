I enjoyed this hotel the most. It has a great location for tourists. It is close to the market place and many other attractions. I found the front desk staff very accommodating (thanks, Christopher) and the rest of the hotel staff very friendly. I loved the beds--very comfortable. Breakfast was included as part of our tour and I enjoyed it very much. Everything that I would want was included in the buffet and the fruit was very fresh. (hi to Morgan--wait staff). The hotel was also very bright and clean looking with fresh flowers in the lobby area. If you go to Seattle, try to make a short side trip out to the Boeing Aircraft factory. All of us loved this tour. We found that the people in Seattle, as well as in Portland, were always very willing to help out tourists with directions and suggestions.

We arrived earlier to spend some time with my daughter who lives in San Francisco. First, I agree with many reviewers that the windows are dirty but I found this to be common in many hotels. We were on the street side so there was a constant noise even in the early hours and an annoying sound at night.However, the hotel is very hospitable and the concierge staff great. They had wonderful recommendations and kudos to Jeff Clavin and his staff. They seemd to be constantly on duty even in the early morning hours. They had some good tips about local transportation. The Marriott is in a great location. Take the bus almost anywhere for $1.25. If you want a cable car ride, ride early in the morning or you might have to wait a really long time. We took the cable car to Alcatraz at Fisherman's Wharf and had no problem at 7:30 in the morning. Buy your tickets on line to Alcatraz before or you might be disappointed. We went on a Saturday and the next available ticket was Tuesday. However, there is a standby line with no guarantees, but all the people in the stand by line were able to get on the boat to the island.The breakfast buffet at the Marriott was superb, and the beds were very comfortable. The lobby is very lovely and the staff at the front desk also was very accommodating. All and all, my staff at the Marriott was very good and I would not hesitate to return.
