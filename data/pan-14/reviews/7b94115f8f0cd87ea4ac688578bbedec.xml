Mark's Father and Uncle Bernard and Peter identicle twins are the owners of this lovely hotel, and they are equally welcoming, with wonderful personalities.The rooms are very clean, they serve a great breakfast and the showers are good too - A good shower can be hard to find in Europe! The hotel is in a very safe upper class area, and is opposite the bus stop and only 10 min walk to Victoria station.My husband I will most definately be back, it is a nice place to be. The only down side is there is no lift and plenty of stairs, but they were so helpful it didn't affect us at all.Regards Heidi Sean
