There is a lot of construction around Sky Harbor so it is a little tricky with the black letters on white signs to see where to turn and they are set back a little from the road. So if you get turned around you can be hunting a while. We finally found this hotel, and while we were hunting we called and honestly I let the phone ring until it times out each time with your party is not answering. Well I think it should be embarassing to any hotel chain when a customer is in line in your lobby to check in, finally gets up, is holding the cell phone in their hand and has to ask the clerk why he is not answering the phone and you have been standing there calling the hotel to see if anyone ever answers. I asked him if he knew what that sound was... The next morning at checkout, the response from the daytime manager was he was probably out smoking when you tried to call for directions, the only problem was there was another woman there who they claimed was a trainee, apparently they had not gotten so far as to the phone. I would have likely knocked $20 off my bill for the frustration; but if you don't have to, then you don't have to. The Hilton across the way has a very nice lounge (none at the SLepp Inn) and my burger was good as well. The rooms were nice, clean, quiet and comfortable, now if they could hire staff for the hotel you'd be all set!
