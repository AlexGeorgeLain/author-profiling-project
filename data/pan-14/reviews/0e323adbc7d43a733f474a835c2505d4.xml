If we hadn't already made prior arrangements for a condo, we would have loved to have stayed longer. They did a great job with the recent renovation. The look is fresh, modern, sleek and clean. Even the smallish bathroom is renovated to maximize the use of space and light so you feel like it's much larger than it actually is. The bed was probably the most comfortable I've slept in for awhile. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They are all warm, friendly and helpful - from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff we encountered in the halls and elevators. They truly exemplify the spirit of Aloha.
