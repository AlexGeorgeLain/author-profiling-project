Big, elegant bathrooms. Staff was helpful and the location was perfect -- most of the key points of interest are within walking distance. Good restaurants are nearby. The hotel's own restaurant is also nice, if pricey. My only complaint -- no draft beer. Breakfast is really good.

What makes it so special is the attention of the staff. They will help you with any question. The rooms are good and, most important for those with families, large. As far as I could tell, all were two room suites. We were traveling with a small child, and the in-room washing machine turned out to be essential.Given what the hotel is providing, the location is really a plus, maybe 200 yards from St Mark's square.
