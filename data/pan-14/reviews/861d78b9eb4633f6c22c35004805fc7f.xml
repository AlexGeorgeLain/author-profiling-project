The beach front location is great, it's quiet enough to relax but only a short taxi ride away from the bustle of Kuta.Breakfast was delicious, such a good choice and so fresh.There are a few restaurants around which are nice too, not much nightlife but Kuta is just down the road.Rooms aren't huge, but definitely comfortable and clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful. At night there are lizards all over the place (not in rooms unless you leave a window open!) but that's to be expected.Would definitely stay here again, in fact, I can't wait to go back.
