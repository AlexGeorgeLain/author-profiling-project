Check in was OK and the desk clerk was helpful with planning a city tour. Upon entering the room my friend and I were barely able to wend our way between the overlarge pieces of furniture and beds. The opening to the dressing room/closet/vanity area was less than 23, located directly off of the entry area to the room. There were a total of nine lamps and wall fixtures, of which only 2 could be lighted. They offer a nice breakfast, included in the price of the room, but the eating area becomes quite messy as the morning passes. There seemed to be a shortage of staff, at least while we were there. It was a big football game weekend and the hotel was at full occupancy. The bed linens were said to be new, but the mattress and box springs were very worn and shabby. The color scheme of the draperies, upholstery and bedding was disconcerting. We wrote a letter to the corporate headquarters detailing our dissatisfaction and received a quasi form letter explaining that they are in the process of redecorating some rooms, so the rooms might have had both old and new furniture in them. No other excuse was given for the lighting problems. This particular room should really not have been offered to guests. Usually Best Western has been quite satisfactory, but this occasion was not up to their advertised standards.
