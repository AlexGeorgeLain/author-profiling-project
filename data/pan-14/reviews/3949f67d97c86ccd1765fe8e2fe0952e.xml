The family room had four beds so it could sleep four persons (two beds were rather small but sufficient for children). The room was not sound proof, you could hear the people next door and upstairs. As we were awakened by noise (from other rooms/hallways) for several nights we cannot give the hotel a higher score. The location of the hotel was its main asset, right next to placa Catalunia and the Ramblas. All the main attractions in the Barri Gotic could be reached by foot. We had a public transport pass for two days, it is very easy to us the public transportation in Barcelona.
