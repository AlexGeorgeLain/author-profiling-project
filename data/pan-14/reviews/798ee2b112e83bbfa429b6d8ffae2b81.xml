The rooms were very satisfactory nothing I could complain about. The Hotel is well located. The subway is all but a step away from the main reception and we could get about the city very easily. The harbour is about a 10 minute walk, for some good restaurants and walking at night was as safe as any other city.The only disappointing aspect was the noisy street, but this didn't prevent sleep or cause distraction.
