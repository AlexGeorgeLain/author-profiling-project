We can confirm the friendly staff and the excellent breakfast, which was available until 10.30 a.m. Our room was a standard room but was very well appointed and with plenty of space. Even though we were overlooking the main road the noise was not a problem apart from the sirens of the emergency vehicles passing by but we could hear these all over Barcelona anyway. Thankfully either I slept soundly or the sirens did not operate after midnight because I did not have a disturbed sleep.If you arrive at Barcelona airport then the aerobus outside each terminal is worth taking into the Plaza Catalunya as they depart every 6 minutes and only take 15- 20 minutes to get there for a modest When you arrive in the centre go back to the other side of the square and you will see the Cafe Zurich at the top of La Rambla - keep this on your right hand side and walk up Calle Pelai and you will see the University at the top. Turn left and the hotel is 2 blocks on the right hand side. An easy 10 -15 minute walk at most.
