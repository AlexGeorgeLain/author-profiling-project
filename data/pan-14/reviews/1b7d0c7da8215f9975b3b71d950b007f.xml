The room was just lovely after a long flight from Heathrow.The reception staff always said hello or mostly bonjour! The locationwas perfect, close enough to Times Square and 6th Avenue for some fun but quiet enough for some peace!There was also a great restaurant almost next door which did some great breakfasts!We drank at the bar both nights and had some great fun.Could not fault this hotel at all.

I was on my own on a business trip and this hotel just made me feel at home.Room was fantastic ! Book or ask for a Harbourview, it is really worth it. Pool on roof was excellent, as was the gym,All the restaurants, well, buffet and steakhouse were fantastic ! I really could not recommend this hotel more. Plus star ferry to central is a 5 min walk away !Don't stay down Nathan Road, just visit it !! Its lovely to get away from the crowds and head back to Hung Hom.
