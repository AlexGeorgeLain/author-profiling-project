It was a little out of the centre but the tourist bus stopped right outside the hotel and the trams and metro were less than two minutes walk away. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was cleaned every day and the mini bar- which was free was restocked everyday too. There are rules regarding taking your own food and drink into the rooms but we didnt find this a problem- we were never stopped taking our purchases upstairs. Our room was the top floor which meant a lift ride up 26 floors- great as the lift was glass and you could see for miles. This was great for views of the Sagrada Familia etc. Room was fairly big with a large comfortable bed, great power shower and blackout blinds and sky TV. Staff were friendly and always willing to help. Room service was avaliable. I would definately book the Barcelona Princess if i return to Barcelona.
