The hotel is on a quiet leafy street and felt very safe. Chelsea is a busy neighbourhood which felt very down-to-earth and full of real New Yorkers. We stayed in 2 different types of room - standard and deluxe. Both were spotlessly clean and very pretty. The standard was small but perfectly adequate with a shared toilet across the hall- also spotless. The deluxe was definitely worth the small extra fee- very spacious with separate ensuite shower/ toilet. Both showers very good. The website photos do not do the rooms justice and Chelsea Lodge is excellent for such a reasonably priced hotel. Staff were very helpful yet unobtrusive. No breakfast on offer, though not a problem as loads of places nearby for breakfast, lunch, dinner/ nights out etc.The Chelsea Lodge is a charming hotel which is perfect for those who want something affordable and a bit different yet clean, safe and reliable. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to other visitors.
