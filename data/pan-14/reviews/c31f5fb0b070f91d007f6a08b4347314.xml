Can't believe that this wouldn't have been painted.We were woken up at 7am one morning by the room immediately next to ours being cleaned. The amount of noise coming from the bathroom being cleaned was enormous. Very inconsiderate. What a time to clean a room!!!!Also we requested and paid for a Deluxe room but we don't think this is what we were given.The room looked tired and the carpet on the third floor pretty old.Not so on the second floor leading to the Spa and pool. I guess this is kept nice because of the number of people using this area.Would think twice before staying here again, judging by our room, I would say if the rest of the hotel was the same, it needs a refurbishment.Not the hotels fault, but the massive construction site next door unfortunately spoils the outlook. We asked for a quite room and got one.
