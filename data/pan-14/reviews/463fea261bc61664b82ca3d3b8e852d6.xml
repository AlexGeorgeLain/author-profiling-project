Only 2 mins walk from the North bus station, and 5 mins from the nearest metro (Arc de Triomf) . Friendly multilingual staff. Free internet access. Small downside: No evening meals (but who wants to eat in the hotel anyway, with that many restaurants about ), and a 15 minute stroll from the centre of things (Placa de Catalunya) . Recommended.
