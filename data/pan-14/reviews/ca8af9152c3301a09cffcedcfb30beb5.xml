The location is ideal in terms of getting to the monorail to take you downtown or the space needle. The rooms are clean with a great big fridge to store your beers etc in.The lobby is inviting with free coffee.It is in a bit of a weird area, right next to a major road.As I say nothing special but good if you are looking for a no frills decent hotel.Paul

		<document id="5f98f590e465613cfade067b48dcb9ca" url=""><![CDATA[Fantastic Hotel We stayed here last July and the standard of service and hotel are both excellent. We were upgraded to a suite and the room was excellent. The lobby was welcoming as were the staff and there is a nice bar behind reception. The hotel is very clean with beds made up etc every day. The bellboys are excellent. Just tell them where you want to go and they will write it down in Mandarin for you so you can give it to the taxi driver.It is fairly close to the centre with about a 20 or 30 minute walk to Tiananmen Square (taxis are cheap though).All in all I cannot recommend it highly enough.
