After a long 15 flight from San Francisco I was able to check in at 9:30 in the morning giving me time too freshen up and get in a full day of sight seeing. The rooms are on the smallish side, but this is the norm for a big city property. The rooms was very clean, quiet and as others have said the location is wonderful. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and attractions are also very accessible. I have no problem recommending this hotel.
