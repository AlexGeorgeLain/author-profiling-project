I really cannot think of anything else to say that hasn't already been said. An excellent alternative to a hotel but with all a hotel's facilities. The two bedrooms with two bathrooms works very well for a family of four. Breakfast was great, La Cupola restaurant, superb, staff helpful and courteous and the apartments were excellent. Absolutely no negative points about this accomodation.It takes less than five minutes to Sagrada Familia and the metro. The T-10 ticket is worth buying. Whatever you decide to visit be prepared for some lengthy queues, especially Sagrada Familia. This is the beauty of staying at Hispanos Siete Suiza. You can get there before all the tour buses and believe me there can be quite a few!
