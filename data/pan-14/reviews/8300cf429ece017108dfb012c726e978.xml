Fillet mignon Sirloin steak.The Lobster house was an eye opener with the size of the Lobster.The Staff throughout the whole complex couldnt do enough for you.( A dollar tip is greatfully received) less than 50p.We booked through a company called Blue Bay travel which saved us pounds as compared with Thomsons etc.Even though we flew with ( everything extra)Thomsons. The only downside if it is a downside was that the sea is not suitable to swim in even though the beach was beautiful.In conclusion if you are looking for an adult only resort this has got to be the winner.
