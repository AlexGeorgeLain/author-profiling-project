However, when we entered our room we were hit with a strong mold odor and could see mold along the top and bottom of the wall between the bathroom and main space. When we tried to call down to the front desk to report the problem the phone didn't work. We dragged our luggage back down to the front desk and were given another room. This room smelled better but still had a slight odor and visible evidence of past water damage. We knew ahead of time that the hotel is undergoing renovations and will not allow guests to open the sliding doors to the balconys . However, we had not realized the balcony doors offer the only available fresh air source above the lobby level. This does not help the obvious moisture issues. The air quality was so bad we hardly slept, felt ill and checked out the following morning. The hotel lobby, which includes a bar and seating areas, has already been renovated and might be a nice place to be if it had decent lighting. The front desk staff were okay. The valet staff were rather agressive - we had 4 people on our car the first moment we pulled in and found it a bit much. We won't be going back.
