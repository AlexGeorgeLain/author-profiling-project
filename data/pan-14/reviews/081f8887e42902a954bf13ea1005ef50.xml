Waikiki is a BIG city! The images mainlanders have of Hawaii are that of palm trees blowing gently in the breezes, this is not it! I live in the Los Angeles area and it felt way too close to home. My wife and I couldn't wait to leave Waikiki. As for Ohana East. I was given a room on the first floor eye level with the bus stop/hooker hangout. Yep, I said hooker hangout. I requested another room and was told by the staff that there were no other rooms available. And as for the buses, they run pretty regularly. Through most of the night. About 20 feet from the sliding glass door. It was aweful. My wife and I contacted Pleasant Holidays whom we have used a half dozen times before and they got us over to Kaui where the pace was just what we had hoped for. Relaxed. Point being if you live in a city and are flying anywhere from 5-10 hours to get away from the hustle and bustle, go to Maui away from Lahaina or for a rural really slow paced vacation head over to Kaui. Good times friends.
