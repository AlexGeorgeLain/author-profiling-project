The hotel was essentially as described. The rooms were a bit beat up and the carpets were stained. The price was average if the room was in better condition. Would probably not stay their again. The breakfast was very good but a guest should eat on the second floor. The hotel caters to native Japanese visitors and their cuisine is served on the second floor. However, standard omelets, etc. will be custom prepared by a chef in the second floor buffet area. The first floor dining area is OK but not as nice as the second floor area. The dining area is adjacent to a very large indoor aquarium that is beautiful to observe while eating.
