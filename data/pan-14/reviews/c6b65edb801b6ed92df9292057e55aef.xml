It is conveniently located in a quiet street in a classy residential area, about 15 minutes stroll from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs and about 5 minutes walk from the Porte Maillot stop of the Air France airport shuttle bus, which is about 30 minutes from the airport. The staff at the Residence Foch are delightful.
