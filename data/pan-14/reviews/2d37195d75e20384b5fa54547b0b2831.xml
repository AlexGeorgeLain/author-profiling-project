I wish we could have stayed longer (but we were heading to Kyoto) The Peninsula was beautiful! Our room was absolutely gorgeous- I have never stayed somewhere so nice. It is super modern with all the electronic amenities that Japan does so well. I loved pressing all the buttons everywhere to see what htey would do. The bed was very comfortable, the rainforest shower was fantastic. The front desk was very polite, helpful, and spoke English well. My only complaint would be that the restaurants were very expensive and this hotel is very upscale- such that us Americans felt severely underdressed wearing jeans and walking through the lobby. This isn't really a place to relax and be yourself- everyone looked like they fell out of a fashion magazine- but maybe that's just Tokyo for you. All in all- a very nice stay and well worth the money.
