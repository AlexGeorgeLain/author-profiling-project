Got a good deal for 5 star hotel including breakfast,although found out gym/steam room was not included in price. It's something that i did not expect and was disappointed with.The hotel is the 3rd tallest hotel in the Word so i was told and has a good reputation. It is an old hotel and rooms are fine, nothing special. Swimming pool area is excellent and worth a visit.The location of this hotel is excellent with MTR a minute walk away. Excellent shopping mall joins onto this hotel.Top floor(71st/72nd floor) has a club and restaurant.The view is really good.Breakfast buffet is very good.Singapore is a great place to visit especially Night Safari,Sentosa Island,Zoo and for shopping. We stayed only 2.5 days and felt 4-5 days would have been better.

The view you have from the top floor whilst you jog is really nice. Steam room and sauna are worth a visit and if weather is nice try the pool outside with again great views.Locationwise it may not appeal to everyone as it is not in the main Kowloon but it did not cause me a problem as there is a free shuttle bus going from hotel to main Kowloon and back every half hour. If you want to go to Hong Kong Island you can talk the ferry which is 5 mins walk away.The area in which the hotel lies has shopping malls within 5 mins walk. I would recommend this hotel as it is very modern and clean. Don't let the location put you off and remember taxi's are very cheap here too.
