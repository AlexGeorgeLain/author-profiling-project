Although the majority of the staff we encountered was helpful, some were not as willing to go beyond their call of duty. The use of the business centre is not free (which in my opinion it should be if you're staying at a 4* hotel), and the computer itself was ancient and slow. The room was small and cozy but we found hairs on our bed sheets which made us question the cleanliness of the place. The hallways had a funny smell too. The bathroom although small was clean so no major complaints there. The walls are paper thin so be sure to bring ear muffs. The hotel's location is not the best, but convenient enough for the metro stop Alonso Martinez which connects about 3 lines of the metro including #10 which takes you to Barajas Airport. The hotel is also close enough to La Chueca which was cool.

The hotel itself is on a quiet street yet close enough to Plaza and Av. Para.lel where one can catch the metro or the Airbus to El Prat Airport. Room was clean and efficient with a sparklingly clean and spacious marble shower. The staff was unbelievable helpful and the bar staff absolutely charming. Highly recommended...
