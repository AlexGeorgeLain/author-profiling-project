Room was small but as to be expected in Europe. The room was very clean. No view but the room was very quiet. The water and juice in the minibar were free. Free wireless. Bed was pretty hard but every bed I slept in while in France was hard. Not sure what that's about. The location was perfect. I will definitely return.
