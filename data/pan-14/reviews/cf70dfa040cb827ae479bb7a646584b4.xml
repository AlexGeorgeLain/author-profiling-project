I went with my boyfriend but if I ever go back for a girls trip, I would feel safe staying here again. There a numerous restaurants just outside and loads of shopping (FCUK and HM are all stone throws away). The only complaints are that the walls are thin and the room smelled a bit musty. These in my books are minor issues.
