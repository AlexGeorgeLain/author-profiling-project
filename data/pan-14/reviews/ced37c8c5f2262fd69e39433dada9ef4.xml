I've stayed at the Millenium Hilton on two other occasions, and both were good experiences except for the front desk and some of the noise from the WTC construction. I didn't mean to select the neighborhood when I was putting my bid in on Priceline, and I also didn't mean to put in the dollar amount I did been working way too much for a month before so I guess I needed a break more than I thought. Anyway, I wound up with the Millenium Hilton accepting my bid.I immediately called asking to be on the non-WTC-facing side. However when I got there I was confirmed for WTC-facing. Angie explained that the king beds are all WTC-facing. She offered a queen bed on the opposite side, but I needed a king for this trip. She moved us to floor 49 she was so friendly, patient, and informative, we just loved her.We ordered room service that night and the burgers were amazing. Salad not so great, but the burgers had filled us up anyway (we ordered way too much for two people). It was expensive, but typical of room service and very tasty.Easy checkout via the internet tv.
