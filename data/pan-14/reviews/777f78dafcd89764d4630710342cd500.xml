It is within a block of Bourbon Street. I was there just before Christmas and during the week. It was quiet but may be noisy on the week ends. You can walk to everything in the quarter. The service was excellent in the hotel. They upgraded us without a problem. The maid service was very accomadating of our requesting a late room clean. Our suite was very spacious and clean. The staff even took care of getting us a cab for the ride back to the airport.
