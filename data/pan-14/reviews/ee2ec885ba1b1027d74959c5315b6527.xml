So glad we picked the Jury's for our stay - it gave us reassurance as soon as we stepped through the door that this was going to be a fantastic stay.The beds are.... words cannot describe the opulence and comfort. The staff are just wonderful, they would break their backs for you and the location is top, you are just a few minutes walk from Newbury street (I recommend The Closet...Jimmy Choos for $110!) and about a 30-minute stroll to Downtown crossing.I just cannot find fault with this place and I would challenge anyone to pick holes in the fine location, services and staff relations. This is by far THE best hotel I have ever stayed in, in the US. So people, book up and enjoy. What's to lose?
