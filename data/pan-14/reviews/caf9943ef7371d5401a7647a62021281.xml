We were greeted by smiling bellhops, to whom we gladly gave our bags.Check in took a few minutes, with a 10% discount applicable if paying in efectivo Service was professional.We were escorted up to an attractive room on the 6th floor, in the center of the hotel, well away from the disco. The room had a window onto an airshft, which was fine with us, as we were there to sleep before our flight.We went down to the bar to unwind, and had a beer and a Tequila a la bandera, at reasonable prices. We didn't try the restaurant.The bath in the room had the aforementioned purified water tap, of which I was a bit leery, but all was well. The shower was great, with hot water at decent pressure arriving quickly. The wi-fi worked well and without interruption. The beds were comfortable.We'd stay there again. In our more youthful travels, we'd stayed at cheaper, more atmospheric places, but the comfort gained now was well worth the added cost.
