We hadn't expected that and weren't able to truly take advantage of having a kitchen, but will keep it in mind for future trips. The pools at this hotel are small, but you are within a very short walk of a nice beach, so no problem. Our view was of the road and the mountains, but the outlook was quite pleasant considering it wasn't the ocean. We enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff were wonderful--helpful with suggestions of how to get around and what to see. We used their parking for $20 a day and figured it was a bargain. Honolulu is a fun place and we had a great time. We will return to the Illikai next time we go to Oahu.
