Nadia is in a beautiful building a short 5 min walk from Dam square. You can pretty much get to every landmark in this happening city from Hotel Nadia within a 20 min walk, or even quicker from a tram that stops 2 minutes away from the hotel. The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day with very helpful personnel, especially Osam, the property manager.Though rooms are really tiny (expected for the price and for Amsterdam), there is ample shelving for luggage; every room is equipped with a private shower and toilets; free breakfast is sufficient and included in the price. The quad room has a spectacular view and lots of room to hang out. For the reasonable price and excellent location, Hotel Nadia is a very good choice for Amsterdam!
