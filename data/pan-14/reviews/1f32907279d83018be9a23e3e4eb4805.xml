I learned a valuable lesson, don't listen to everything you hear. This hotel is old, needs renovating. If you want ammenities go somewhere else, if you want a room to sleep/shower in, book this hotel. Perfect location for getting onto Waikiki beach or jumping on H1 to get to Northshore or windward side of the island. The staff seemed nice, although I never asked them for one thing the entire time. The restaraunt was cheap and the food was descent. The room, well it had clean beds and a clean bathroom, that's all I care about. I was never kept up by noise at night, although in the morning you could hear the birds in the zoo, which I enjoyed. Parking is $15/day and the lot always had an open spot somewhere. The only complaint that I have is the elevators were slow during peak times like 9-10 am and 5-7 pm. We were gone doing stuff the entire time we stayed in this hotel so it was great for us, if you plan to use your room for more than a sleeping/hygiene spot then I would recommend another hotel.
