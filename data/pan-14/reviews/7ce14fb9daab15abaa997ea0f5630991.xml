The hotel is in the futuristic Shiodome area, and the building the hotel is in has a massive open atrium that is sure to impress anyone on their arrival. The front desk was very friendly, and had even held a bit of luggage for us at no charge since we had started in Tokyo and did not want to haul it around with us while we saw other parts of Japan.The rooms themselves are unremarkable, but clean and efficient. Like others have said, there is not much to do right in Shiodome, but Ginza is a short walk away, as is the Tsukiji fish market and Hama Rikyu garden. It is also possible to connect to the JR lines and subway directly from the hotel building (10-15 mins walking underground).A breakfast is included (Japanese and Western), and both of us enjoyed it - definitely a plus.
