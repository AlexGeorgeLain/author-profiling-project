This is my favorite hotel in the world!Absolutely beautiful rooms, generously sized and amazingly appointed.We stayed here two years ago, were very, very impressed with the quality of the rooms and the amazing friendliness of the staff. This year, we stayed in the annex (a misnomer - this is the newly renovated section of the hotel, a 500 year old building with its own bridge off its beautiful courtyard (used for breakfast) over its canal, where the rooms are even more beautiful than in the original section. The owners, Sandro and Walter, are wonderfully friendly and helpful, and seem more like old friends than hoteliers.Especially interesting to me was the quality of their renovation: the wood work (baseboards, moldings, doors, etc., was of such high quality that I despair of ever finding furniture so well finished in the USA, let alone woodworking. The hotel is located within 50 yards of the St. Stae Vaporetto stop, in a non-tourist area (a big plus for us), yet very convenient for reaching all other popular parts of the city. The neighborhood is very relaxing, a good place to go after the crowds in San Marco. Some very good restaurants are located within walking distance, and we were able to walk to several of the Scuolae with the most important art work in Venice.I plan to return to this hotel each time we come back to Europe.
