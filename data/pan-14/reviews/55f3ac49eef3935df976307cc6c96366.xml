Hotel very clean.Staff couldn`t have been more pleasant or helpful.Garden area brilliant after a day sight-seeing.There is a bar in the street where customers do spill onto the pavement--walking on the other side solves the problem! Hotel within walking distance of most sights/galleries--however taxis didn`t seem expensive when used.Would certainly stay here again
