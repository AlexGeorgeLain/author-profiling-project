The location is right in the middle of the theatre district, so we could walk to most places we wanted to visit. This hotel had friendly service, and most reasonable prices. I was a bit dubious when I booked because the prices were so reasonable $185/night on weekdays, $215 on weekends. The room was larger than I had expected. Very comfortable bed - nice marble bath. There was little traffic noise (we were on the 14th floor). I highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely stay there again.
