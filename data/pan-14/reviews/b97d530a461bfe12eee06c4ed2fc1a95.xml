We only had one night in Venice on November 20, 2006 due to flight schedule after a cruise. We chose this lovely hotel because of all the rave reviews written on this site. We were definitely not disappointed. We agree with all the other comments, plus we have an additional plus to add. I received an email from Walter and Sandro the day after I arrived home letting me know that the cleaning ladies had found my credit card and that it was now in the hotel safe awaiting my instructions. I hadn't even missed my card yet! So, in addition to charm, cleanliness,location, etc., add honesty of the owners and staff. If given the opportunity, we will gladly return to this gem!
