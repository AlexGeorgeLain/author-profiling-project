No noise from street as promised, yet you can open the windows if so desired. Definitely right where the action is. Don't miss the open Market just down the street, same side towards the ocean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant also very good. Restaurant is on Rick Steve's list.

Clean rooms, friendly staff and great views of the plaza from our balcony. Also the restaurant had some of the best food we had on the trip. Within walking distance to the Prado one direction and the Palace the other. Wish I could have stayed longer, Also 1 block away is the Dept store El Corte Ingles. Don't miss their wine and cheese.
