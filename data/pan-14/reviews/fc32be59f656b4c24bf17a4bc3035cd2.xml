It's location is perfect, right in the middle of the financial district, which makes it the ideal location to get to the entertainment district and the shopping.In the whole week spent in Toronto not once didI need to use any form of transportation other than my two feet.There is breakfast available in the hotel, but just a block or two away are two fantastic eateries for your first meal of the day, both on Yonge St - Over Easy and the Sunset Grill, which will leave you ready for the day ahead.Would certainly reccomend this hotel to anyone visiting Toronto, great value for money and the staff are helpful and friendly.
