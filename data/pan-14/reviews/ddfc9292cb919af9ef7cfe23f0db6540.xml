The hotel is very modern, very stylish and located across the water from the main city. Its only a few minutes from the ferry so also very convenient. Our room was large, very comfortable with excellent views of Hong Kong Island and the ever-changing scene of boats, junks etc. The bathroom was huge, marble and had a walk in shower and separate bath. We ate in the restaurant one evening, and the food was good, but not special. Its buffet style. There was a wedding going on, which provided endless amusement and interest. There is a roof top pool with spectacular views and plenty of sun beds. We would return to this hotel for its quiet location after the frantic pace of the city.
