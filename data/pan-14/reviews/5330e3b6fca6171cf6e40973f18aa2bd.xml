When we arrived we were greeted warmly. I had had a horrific day so I was looking forward to getting to our room asap so I could unwind. I briskly walked out of our car and straight to the lobby. I was greeted by at least two or three hotel employees and they somehow already knew my name. We stayed in a club floor room which is worth the extra $100 or so. Our room was beautiful and recently renevated(?). The club staff were definately there to ensure a pleasant stay. The food was lite but yummy and the drinks made by Johnathon were perfect. Francisco and Crystal also made sure our stay was perfect. Crystal even got us in last minute reservations for Aqua for my birthday dinner. Thanks Ritz-Carlton for making my birthday relaxing, fun and overall a very pleasant experience. Can't wait to return. Sorry I don't have any photos but I believe our room # was 823. It is at the end and very quiet.
