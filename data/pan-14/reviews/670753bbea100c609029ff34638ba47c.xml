We have just spent three nights there and found the Art Deco styling a pleasant change from the normal US hotel rooms. The continental breakfast is good with a choice of cereal, muffins, begels, toast, yogurt and fruit. Free tea and coffee are served all day which was a nice touch (although it meant no in-room facilities).The staff were efficient and polite although not over friendly apart from the doorman Mathew who was always smiling and very helpful. If you like Chineses food the restaraunt a couple of doors along is reasonable and frequented predominently by oriental patrons (it's the one that does display the prices and is nearest to the hotel)New York is always noisy but be aware that there is some construction work going on adjacent to the hotel which will impact on your rest if you want a lie in, we were up by 06:30 and out fairly swiftly so were not affected.Finally, skip the trip to the top of the Empire state building and go to the Rockerfeller building (Top of the Rock) after dark and enjoy a far better view, and you get to see the Empire State Building all lit up.
