I had a free certificate from a friend who is a member of Accor Privilege Card, and tried to use it in Novotel Nusadua. I have no problem booking through Accor hotline service, and reconfirmed the booking 4 days prior to our intended stay directly to the hotel. Again, the staff at Novotel Nusa Dua confirmed the booking and told me to show the certificate when I checked in.We checked in on 11 November only to find that our certificate was rejected because the front desk staff said that the certificate is for Accor Privilege Card member only, and I have to show the copy of member card (I'm not a member so I don't have one!) although it is clearly stated in the certificate that it is fully transferable and it doesn't said anything about having to be a member to use the certificate.I was very angry and dissapointed so I moved to Harris Resort - which is the best decision I ever made!!!I would not recommend Novotel Nusa Dua at all, and if you have any of these certificate, be very careful before you check in.
