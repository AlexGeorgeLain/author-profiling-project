The location itself is great if you want to see the greater SF area.When we arrived we could park our car next to the front door and were able to get the bags out easily (we parked it later).The check-in was fast and although the staff is not a happy bunch, they were courteous enough.The room on the 6th floor had a good view of the Bridge, which we ordered. Ours was at the end of the hall way next to a rather noisy ice machine, which could be heard in the room. It explained the 'do not unplug this machine' sign. I was tempted though.The beds were soft enough, the bath room was clean, but we found a sticky carpet near the window since somebody dropped a soda on it before us. We reported it, but it remained sticky for all three days.Parking in the hotel garage can be a bit challenging if you have anything over a compact. So be prepared.The hotel is in driving distance from scenic Lombard Street and in walking distance from the Bay (without steep hills).We founds lots of restaurants on Chestnut close by, many other motels can be found there as well. And we didn't skip Mel's diner on Lombard for a hearty breakfast.Sure, this place could be better. But the things we encountered were no biggies. We'd choose the Comfort Inn again when we go back to San Francisco. We had three good night's sleep.
