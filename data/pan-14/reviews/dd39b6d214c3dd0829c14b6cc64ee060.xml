Could not have been better value, great facilities, good rooms, cool piano bar, good location, nice staff. Couldn't think up a complaint if I tried. Really liked the pool and sauna / steam room as they were clean and usually empty. Also, it's nice to be able to sit by the pool and order a beer from the bar there. Piano bar is seriously cool and they had a fairly talented guy playing and singing there one night, he was very entertaining and played requests. Staff are very courteous and helpful. I can't fault this hotel, I'd definitely return.
