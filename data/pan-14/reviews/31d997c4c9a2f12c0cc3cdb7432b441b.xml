I selected it from a list of possibilities from the convention's housing bureau. I have been to Amsterdam may times before, and I know that I wanted a hotel that was not in the heart of the tourist area. I also wanted a hotel that was closer to the Rai Convention Center. These are both true for this Bastion hotel.Location: This hotel is between two tram stops (lines 1 and 17, stops Surinameplein and Derkinderenstraat) and about a 15-minute walk from the Lelylaan Metro station. The tram stops are about 10 minutes either way. The location is a little isolated, so if you don't like to walk in a business area, choose another location. I always felt safe, even when walking at night, but I'm a 6' 1 man. Likewise, if you don't want to walk, this is not the hotel for you.While Amsterdam is a major city, the central area is actually rather compact. Twice during our stay we walked from Centraal Station to the hotel. It takes a while, but it's not impossible.Services: There are no other restaurants next to the hotel. There are some (mostly snack stops) near Surinameplein, but that's at least a 15-minute walk. You can always take a tram to another part of town.The hotel has a restaurant with a short menu. We ate here twice during our stay. The food was good and the portions were larger than I usually see at European hotels.Breakfast is not included in the room charge. My room rate for a double was 101 Euros per night, plus 12 Euros per person for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is typical of those in Europe with breads, rolls, cheeses, sliced meats, fruit, cereal, boiled eggs and scrambled eggs and bacon.I like to send postcards during my trips, and I found a post office just beyond the Lelylaan Metro station. As you leave the hotel and walk toward the Metro station on Schipluidenlaan, walk under the train overpass. The road name changes to Pieter Calandlaan. There is a row of shops on the left side of the street, and behind them is a post office (Post Kantoor).Staff: All of them were mostly helpful. I did not receive any worthwhile restaurant suggestions from the people I asked. They all said to take the tram to the busy areas of town. Except for one person, I felt that they were all at work just to earn a paycheck and not there because they enjoyed working with people.There is a secured parking lot available for a daily fee. Lots of parking is available on the street, although the hotel suggests using the secured lot. I did not see any signs of crime on the street, but the somewhat isolated location makes it a good spot for potential trouble.There is a construction project in progress across the street. I don't know what it being built. The construction vehicles did not interrupt our stay in the evenings and at night. However, at 8 a.m., the pile driver started hammering. We had an early start each morning, so this did not affect us. (CS)

From the outside, this building does not look like it would offer much for a hotel. It's painted in an odd dark pink color. There are statues like those from a Roman bath placed around the property. I booked a room for one night through an online service because the rate was decent and the posted reviews said that it was ok. When I arrived I was concerned that I made a mistake.Once inside, I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby welcomes you. The small front desk is clean and orderly, and I was helped immediately by a courteous man. Once inside the room, I found a clean space with a microwave, mini fridge and two queen beds. The bathroom looks like it was updated fairly recently. The air conditioner has an electronic thermostat, so it was easy to find a comfortable temperature.I wanted a hotel near the Ft. Lauderdale airport so I would not have to drive very far for my early morning flight. According to my GPS, the hotel is 14 miles from the airport. That's not exactly next door, but it was an easy drive.There are several restaurants about 0.5 miles north of the hotel. There is easy access to the Florida Turnpike. The hotel entrance is on County Line Road, and entrance and exit is only possible from the Eastbound lane. U-turns are not allowed at the County Line Road intersection heading west, so turn left (south) onto NW 27th Ave. (Unity Drive) and make the U-turn there.The hotel says that it has free wireless Internet access in all the rooms, but it did not work during my visit. My room was on the third floor. When I called the front desk to ask if there was a problem, it was suggested that I come to the lobby and use it. A practical alternative, but not the ideal solution at midnight.I booked the room through Bookit.com, which had the best posted rate available.The even-numbered rooms face the race track, and if you want to watch a race from your room, be sure that you are on at least the fourth floor to clear the trees.

I chose the Courtyard because it was less expensive than other business and branded hotels within a few blocks of the convention center. I booked through the Marriott website and had a rate of $199 per night.The hotel looks to be newer. Everything is clean and working perfectly. The lobby is inviting. My room was on the 8th floor and faced northwest. My room had a king-sized bed, a couch (pull-out sleeper), and a desk. The room was comfortable and had plenty of room. The bathroom was also larger than I expected, but it looks to be ADA compliant, hence the extra room. The bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of pillows.The hotel was quiet. I never heard any noise outside my room. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick. I asked for a restaurant suggestions one night, and I was given several options from which to choose.The hotel is 2.5 blocks from the entrance to the Moscone Center. It's 3 blocks from Market Street and the Montgomery BART station. There are plenty of restaurants within a few blocks.While I think nearly $200 is a high price for a hotel room, this was cheaper than many rooms in the area, so I will consider it a good value based on the local market.I reserve giving a full 5 rating for truly exceptional stays and values, and this Courtyard comes very close. This hotel has easily earned my rating of 4 and then some. I would definitely stay here again. (CS)

Rooms at the Garden Inn were about $25/night cheaper than the Hilton Anatole, and the Garden Inn is across the street, so I figured that it would be a good compromise. I have stayed at other Garden Inn hotels, so I had an idea what to expect.The Garden Inn is like other Garden Inns. The lobby is spacious, the room was large and clean. It's near the freeway, but outside noise was not a problem. My room did not face the highway. The room was also secure.Walking across the street is not a major problem, but I had to cross the entire Hilton Anatole parking lot in a suit on a hot September day. I did not have to make trips to and from the Anatole and the Garden Inn, so it was not a problem for me, but plan accordingly if you are making the budget-minded move.The staff was about the best I have ever experienced. They were all friendly, courteous, and ready to help; even with offering me a ride in the hotel van to the Post Office about a mile away.Decent business value and top-notch staff make this a good hotel to return to.
