This place is fantastic. everything you think old San Francisco should be. the bellman are great, always there but never obtrusive. they welcome us back by name. sure, it's because they're great recordkeepers, but it still feels good! the concierges have always been good. we've never had the same twice, but they employ the best, so it doesn't matter. we typically come in from Ohio, spend two or three nights here and then head up to Sonoma. we always have a car delivered on the morning we're leaving and it's never once been screwed up. if you travel a lot, you know that's unusual. makes me think they have a great reputation in town. we never eat there, but that's not a commentary on the restaurant - we just like to get out and check out other things. this past July, the restaurant was closed, as was the bar, for renovations. it was a bit of a disappointment, as we like to grab coffee, or a drink when we get home at night. the great thing was that they called us two days before we arrived to warn us about the closings - in case that would be too inconvenient for us. the rooms are great. the suites are very large, the regular rooms very roomy for an old hotel. location at the top of nob hill cannot be beaten. linens, beds, towels - all great. also, most rooms seem to have a window in the shower which we just love. there are probably a lot of hotels that are much cooler than this one, but we love it here. very worth the expense.
