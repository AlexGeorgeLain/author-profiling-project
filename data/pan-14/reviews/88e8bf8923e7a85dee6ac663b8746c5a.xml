Yes, there are homeless, there are people asking for money, there are fire trucks and people arguing in the street late at night. Maybe I'm different, but I expect this in a city. It's the same experience at the 39-story Marriott. If you don't want it, don't book a hotel in the city.The hotel itself was spotless, as was the room. The beds were comfortable, and the morning coffee excellent. I stayed on the fourth floor, and while there was noise from the street, it wasn't bad, in my opinion, and was exactly what I would expect being in the city.The attached restaurant, Farmer Brown had wonderful food, good drinks and a friendly waitstaff. It's more expensive than Dennys, but much better.Overall, a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anybody looking to stay in the area.
