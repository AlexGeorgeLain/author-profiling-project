The hotel was smaller than I had expected, but the service was great, our room was very nice and comfortable and the location was excellent - it was so easy to get around Paris by using the metro station nearby, and it was very convenient to be so close to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. The reception area is nicely decorated and the buffet breakfast was tasty. The Cecilia has everything you need.
