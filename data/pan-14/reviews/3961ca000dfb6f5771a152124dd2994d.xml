The velib' bikes which you can hire across paris have a station 100m away near the metro station. There is also a tram and bus. Didn't hire a car but noticed that Avis is just across the road.We found the number 80 bus better as it goes through ecole militaire (the end of the eiffel tower park), Champs Elysees and finishes quite close to Montmatre. It seemed quite quick as well.So would highly recommend taking the bus instead of the metro into town.Rooms were great, TV had french, german and British stations including BBC 1, BBC 2 and Sky News.If you want food theres a pizza restaurant and takeaway chinese takeaway just across the road. Theres a KFC, Mcdonalds, a large supermarket and more restaurants a 10 minute walk or 1 metro stop at Convention.
