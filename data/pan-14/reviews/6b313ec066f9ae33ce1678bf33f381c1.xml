This is great when your traveling with two teenagers. However if your looking for tranquility and no noise then select another Island not another hotel. Most of them are right on the strip, at least the nicer ones. The International Market is right across the street along with Macy's a whole bunch of designer stores and a lot of other stores. Lots of Restaurant too! You don't need a car but we did rent one. We used it almost everydate. Parking is expensive $18/day. The hotel staff is very friendly and always willing to help. My only negative comment would be the noise you can hear outside of your room. They need doors that are soundproof. Other reviews had indicated noise heard from the walls but that's not what I experienced. Couldn't hear anyone from the adjoining rooms. Only heard noise from the hallway. Room was fine. We were four in total and were fine with just one room. The room had two double beds and a pullout sofa. Our City view room had a partial view of the ocean. I wouldn't pay for ocean view. If that's what you want just go to the deck or the beach. Note: if you can get a room from the 14th floor and above it's the way to go. Floors 14 and above have a separate elevator. You won't have to deal with the issues other reviewers have mentioned (waiting a long time for an elevatior). For security purposes the elevators do not stop on the lower level after 10 pm. Security roams the floors too. I would definitely stay there again.
