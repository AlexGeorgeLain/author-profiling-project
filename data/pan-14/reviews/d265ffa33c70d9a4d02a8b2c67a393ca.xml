The room was a good size, very clean and comfortable. Excellent en-suite facilities. Room had sitting area with two easy chairs and coffee table.A good hot and cold buffet breakfast is available (10 euros)in the hotel, but there is also an excellent cafe bar just around the corner where you can get bacon and eggs for 3.75 euros. Building work is still going on just across the road (our room looked onto the site) but, unless you want to sleep late, this should not cause problems as work did not start until 8 am and was finished by 6.30 pm.Would certainly use this hotel again - it was a great location. In a quiet street, away from noisy main roads and passing tourists, yet just around the corner from the Cathedral and within easy walking distance of Port Vell, Catalunya Square and the Ramblas.
