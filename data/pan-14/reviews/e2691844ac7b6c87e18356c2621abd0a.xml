The location we found excellent, right in the middle of the financial district and near to the subway station (kings). Our room was great, fully equipmed with everything - washing machine, dryer, microwave, dishwasher. The only thing which let the room down was the view - unfortunately we had an internal room - Floor 13 room 1303. Which meant the room was quite dark and was impossible to see what the weather was doing!! Breakfast was not included, so we had ours at St Lawerence market, which is well worth walking the 2 blocks - the peameal coated bacon sandwiches were amazing!

For the money this hotel is lovely, excellent location, good service, fab breakfast, we had a huge room with 2 double beds. We ate in the hotel on our last night as the snow was too deep to go out! We found the food, despite a rather select menu to be very good value and the service was great. We also went to the Marriot revolving bar and found the drinks to be very over priced and the service terrible. I would not advise anyone to go there.
