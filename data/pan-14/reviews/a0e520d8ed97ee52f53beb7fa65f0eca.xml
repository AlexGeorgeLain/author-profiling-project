The staff were extremely friendly, always willing to help and most, if not all, had a high standard of English.My room was on the sixth floor (which had a pleasant scent of peach), it was clean and comfortable and the TV had three English channels (CNN, BBC and Sky) as well as other channels in French, Spanish and Italian (and obviously German!)The location of the hotel was excellent- it's only a short walk from the KaDeWe (huge shopping centre), the Kaiser Wilheim Gedachtniskirche, the zoo and the Europa Centre.There's also a taxi rank outside if you want to go anywhere else in the city [but be careful- the Taxis in Berlin are not cheap!]The only meal I had in the Hotel was Breakfast. It's buffet style and there is a lot to chose from, including different types of breads, meats, cereals, fruit and juices.The only complaint I have about the hotel is the prices [i.e The Bar, business centre etc..] It's almost for a glass of orange juice in the bar, and a usage time of 15 minutes on the Internet in the business centre costs I was satisfied with my stay in the Crowne Plaza and would stay there again if I return to Berlin.
