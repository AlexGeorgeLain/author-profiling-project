I sleep in a waterbed normally, and most hotel beds are like boards to me, but this bed was, without a doubt, one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in at a hotel. The comfortable bed with the wonderful linens...... I was in heaven. The bathroom was beautiful with a great shower. The room was well worth the price. We enjoyed a glass of wine at the outside tables at the end of each day after miles of walking and taking in the sights of DC. The concierge was helpful and the bartender friendly. The room was spotless and comfortable. What more could you ask for?
