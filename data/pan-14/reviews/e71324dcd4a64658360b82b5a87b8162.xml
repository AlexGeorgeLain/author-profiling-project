The other four hotels on this trip were 4 star and we were shocked to learn that this hotel only has 3 stars. We had by far the largest room of any of our hotels and it included a couch and a window overlooking a garden. The furnishings were very tasteful and the beautiful old hallways were a gallery of very interesting contemporary art. The location is awesome (one block from David at the Academy) and the front desk was very helpful. They are a bit less formal than other hotels at this level and perhaps some people are disconcerted by that. Despite what others have said, the breakfast was fine, although we had to pay a bit extra for the excellent fruit salad.
