Towels were changed twice a day, unless you asked not to. The included buffet breakfast had everything you could possibly want...all kinds of breads, fish, fresh fruit and juice, dry cereals, etc. In addition , they made any hot dish you wanted, eggs, pancakes, etc. to order.The concierge (Marc and Thorsten) desk was fabulous. They made all of our restaurant reservations and the recommendations they added to our selections were excellent. They gave us perfect directions with clarity to all of the places we wanted to see, including Potsdam (Sans Souci)...via train and connecting bus.My wife had left a brooch in our hotel in Dresden. The concierge desk called the hotel we had stayed at; when that hotel, the Taschenbergpalais Kempinske, also excellent ,found the jewelry, they arranged to have the brooch sent overnight mail to us in Berlin without any expense to us.Lunch in the Debrosses Cafe/Bistro was superb. Everyone on the staff was pleasant and cheerful. We have stayed in many deluxe hotels, but the Ritz Carlton Berlin was one of the finest experiences we have ever had........and they had no attitude!
