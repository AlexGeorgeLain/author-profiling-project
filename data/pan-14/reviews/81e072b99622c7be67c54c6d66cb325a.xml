The booking was made well in advance from the Holiday-INN internet web site. This allowed to obtain a great price for what you get (booking however is not refundable). Cost of the room was roughly 100 euro per day (excluding breakfast which is priced around 15 euro).Our room was at the sixth floor and it was silent. It was spacious, clean and with all the things you would expect staying at the Holiday INN.The position of the hotel is close to Darling Harbour and China Town. With a ten minute walk you arrive at Sidney Central Station (we went there to get the trains for the Blue Mountains), in a few minutes you can reach on foot George Street and get the buses that reach Circular Quay (Opera House). So I would say that the position is very convenient (I imagine that the hotels close to the Opera House are much more expansive).The monorail passes adjacent to the hotel but for us it was almost of no use and on the other hand the noise of the monorail was un-noticeable (staying at 6th floor).Reception could be a little bit crowded early in the morning but the staff was helpful and we did not experience any problem whatsoever. I would definitely recommend the hotel and I would return there.
