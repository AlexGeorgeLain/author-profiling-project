It is a sophisticated, clean, well-maintained hotel conveniently located within easy walking distance to the Piazza San Marco. We stayed in the top floor double room that was peaceful and quiet. Our room was bright, airy, and tastefully decorated with an elegant, well appointed bathroom. The room has its own separate sitting area and a small private deck. Every aspect was top quality. The staff provided warm, friendly, and helpful hospitality, speaking fluent English.
