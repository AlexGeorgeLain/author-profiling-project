We were a party of 9 women from London on a 3 day trip to Venice. The hotel was great value, had charming staff, was very well positioned (we arrived by water taxi, and a landing plank was put out for us due to very high water levels), and with very Italian atmosphere.Rooms very well appointed and better than many four star hotels in some cases. Room 5 has a lovely balcony overlooking the canal, but all the rooms we had were quite luxurious. The Proprietors were very helpful and spoke perfect English, putting us all to shame.Will never stay anywhere else when in Venice!!!
