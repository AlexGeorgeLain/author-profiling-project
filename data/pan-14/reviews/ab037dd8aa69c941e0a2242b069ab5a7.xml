The staff were very courtous and nothing was too much trouble. The accommodation, food, cleanliness and facilities we found to be excellent.On the day we were due to fly home to England hurricane Jean hit and the hotel was ravaged by the storm, however, the wonderful staff ensured that we had three hot meals a day, even though we were surrounded by water, completely cut off from the outside world, and had no running water and electricity for three days. The staff accommodation was submerged from below the second floor, however, they continued to cater for all our needs even though they were completely saturated.We were uplifted by the Dominican Army three days later by helicopter off the beach, leaving all our luggage behind, as we were obviously only able to take a small hand luggage bag with us. Our cases arrived home fully intact one week after our belated journey home and I can only thank eveyone concerned from the bottom of my heart for their very unselfish care during this time. Our special thanks go to Pauline and the reception staff who continued to give their unstinting thoughtfulness throughout this farrowing time.We will definitely be returning to this hotel in the not too distant future.
