My husband and I traveled with two friends and our only complaint was that it is impossible to find newspapers. We checked the lobby store each day and there was never a paper in English our entire trip. Our rooms were on what was called the Premier side which we understood meant no children. Thus, it was an extremely quiet, restful area. Buffet food was usually good. The Japanese Restaurant is the best while the French and Seafood weren't impressive. This did not, however, change our feelings about the resort. We would definately go back.
