The hotel is impeccable and certianly a 4 to 5 star hotel. Iit was a great deal. The location was right in the city center on a very quiet street. Staff were courteous and helpful. the buffet breakfast was 10 euros but worth the price. I would definitely stay here again and highly reccomend the hotel.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and very good for the price. We were in a room that faced a wall when looking out the window but it was very quiet. Location was fine for us as we are walkers. We were within 15-20 mins of all the major sites. Highly reccomend a stay here. Oh, and the breakfast each day was great.
