The closest I could get to downtown was this SpringHill Suites. I wish we'd just chosen another city or another time.The suite was small, as with all such hotels of this sort, but was clean. As other reviewers have pointed out, there was some noise. The breakfast was excellent. The bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were abominable--even the replacements we asked them to give us. Free internet access was nice. Our main problem--it was a half- to three-quarter mile walk to any really decent restaurant. And the walk led through a questionable neighborhood. I was negatively impressed by the location, and would not stay here again.Oh, yes. We had a car (parked at $20 per night), but parking in downtown Seattle is a proble,, and quite expensive.
