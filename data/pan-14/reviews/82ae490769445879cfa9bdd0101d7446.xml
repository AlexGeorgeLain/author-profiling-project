We had two rooms both were nice. The bathrooms was very clean all new tile; one had a tub/shower, the one a shower. Our rooms didn't have the view, but faced inside and were quite. I found the front desk to be very helpful with suggestions. There are a couple brasseries close by. Only a couple hundred meters to the Ecole metro. Easy walk to the Eiffel tower, Invalides or other sites in area. I have no problem recommending this hotel if you are looking for a place in this area for a couple nights in Paris.
