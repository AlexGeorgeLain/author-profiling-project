It's modern, stylish and very well equipped e.g DVD CD players, free internet connection, and unlike a lot of older style London hotels everything works well- even the plumbing. Public areas are pleasant and comfortable (and free wi-fi), staff service exceptionally friendly and helpful, bar and restaurant both of good standard. Location is great too - 5-10 minutes walk to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and 2 minutes to the Tate British. Also close to Victoria Station and Bus Station. Can't think of any negatives - room service was excellent and prompt. Perhaps the bathrooms are a little small, and it might be nice to have a bath, but I didn;t really miss it, and the shower worked better than most.
