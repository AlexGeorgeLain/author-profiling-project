The rooms are so modern, clean and new, and I absolutely loved the design of the bathroom. The giant tub which fills from the ceiling is such a treat after trekking around Seattle in the rain and snow. We had two of the lowest grade rooms and I am extremely pleased with the value for money I got. We paid on average $214 Canadian per room per night and for the quality of room design, finishing, attention to detail and superb service, I feel it was excellent value.The hotel is centrally located on First Avenue, close by to Pike's. It is within walking distance (albeit a steep uphill climb) to the shopping district around 6th ave. The service is impeccable. From the moment you walk in, you are taken care of. It is classy and friendly, warm but very discreet and professional. The front desk is efficient and helpful The valet guys were always there to offer an umbrella for the seattle rain and always smiled to make the day more cheerful. I wished i could have stayed longer. It's my perfect idea of a weekend retreat where one can be pampered and indulge in luxury. Smooth and sexy, Hotel 1000 is one place I will be back.
