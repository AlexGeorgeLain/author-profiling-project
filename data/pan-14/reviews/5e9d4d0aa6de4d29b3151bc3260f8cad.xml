The front desk people were amazingly efficient and extremely patient and helpful with our questions and our requests for recommendations. We had a comfortable, well-appointed room overlooking the Singel Canal. The location was perfect in terms of being able to walk to almost all places we wanted to go. We loved everything about this property, but most kudos to the staff who always made us feel welcome and appreciated.
