She is a person with a number of medical problems. On checking in her difficulties were explained to the staff at the reception desk. They provided her with a wonderful room with a balcony with a table two chairs and a lounger which had a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower. The modern decor, spacious bathroom, light quiet atmosphere were very relaxing. When she was quite seriously ill during the night before we were due to leave. The staff could not have been more helpful, kind and efficient. The following day they extended our time of departure to two p.m. and provided advice to get us to Gare du Nord promptly. Their service could not have been improved upon and was a considerable help.
