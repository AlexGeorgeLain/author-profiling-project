We enjoyed our stay, and found the accomodations (a double room) very comfortable, and the staff very helpful. The location was very convenient to public transportation, and a very short walk to La Rambla. It was also just a few doors away from a very good Tapas restaurant. The hotel staff provided us with very good information about touring the city during our brief stay. The breakfast was good, and we found the rate to be reasonable. We would highly recommend this hotel without any concerns about you enjoying it.
