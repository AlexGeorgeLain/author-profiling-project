The best Mai Tai I had in Hawaii and the surf and turf (off the menu) at Orchids and it was FANTASTIC!! The room was smaller than we thought it would be but that is as to be expected in a metropolis. Would absolutely go back!! Important note: they have a suite if you have a late flight to use for internet access, shower and relax if you have a late flight as we did and the front desk neglected to tell us until we had made plans and were executing our late checkout.
