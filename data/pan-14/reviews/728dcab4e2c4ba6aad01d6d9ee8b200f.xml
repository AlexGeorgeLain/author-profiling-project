We enjoyed this place so much, we hope to return again in August with our kids. We booked an executive suite package that included the Cloud Room. Since we did not bring our teenagers on this trip, our daily visits to the Cloud Room were greatly appreciated as it was a holiday weekend and there was no shortage of children of every age here. Everyone was especially helpful here. We thoroughly enjoyed getting ideas and tips from Elizabeth, Concierge at the Cloud room and reviewing our day's events with Sharon in the evening. These two women helped make our weekend exceptional. The most appreciated advice was to use the spa pool since no children were allowed. We enjoyed everything about this weekend: the room, the service, the food, etc. We ate at the steakhouse and our only wish was that they would have offered smaller portions.We hope to receive the same gift next year.

Stayed in a higher room; had no problems with noise. Housekeeping was excellent. Doorman was extremely helpful with getting cabs and car for airport. Would definitely stay here again!
