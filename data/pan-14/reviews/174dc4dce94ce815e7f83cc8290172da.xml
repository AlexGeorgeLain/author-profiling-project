Upon arrival, we received a free room upgrade for a partial ocean view. Nice lobby and perfect location right across from the beach. But room looked kind of old to me - the carpet was stained, I could clearly see a greasy fingerprints all over the walls, and room just didn't smell too good. Bathhrom looked very old too - the paint was chipped in the bath tub. Though the overall experience was OK, I will definetely try some other places next time I'm in Honolulu.
