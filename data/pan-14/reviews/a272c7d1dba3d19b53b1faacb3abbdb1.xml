With two connecting rooms, we were more than comfortable and happy. Hotel is well kept and very modern in style. Buffet breakfast was the best of any location we stayed at. Service top notch. Location near Zoo train station was a plus for getting around to different spots in Berlin. We had an excellent overall visit and would return to this location or other Swissotel properties. I also felt safe and secure and liked the feature that did not allow anyone to enter the elevator without having a key and the elevator would automatically stop only on that floor. For an urban hotel, safety is important to us.
