We arrived 2 days later and were shocked to find ourselves out in the middle of nowhere. To get to the tram line you have to go through a very dodgy underpass and I wouldn't have liked to have been out in the area at night. The room was stifling (you could only open the windows about 10cm) and when you did it was non stop traffic noise. The staff, although pleasant, did not seem very motivated and a 5 to 10 minute wait to be served at the bar was not uncommon even when no one else was there. This is a business hotel and should be advertised as such, we read every review available at the time but nothing prepared us for living in an industrial estate. It was so bad that on the first night we spent most of it on the free internet computer trying to get a flight home!!
