The restaurant area is quite stylish, though empty apart from at breakfast time. We had one breakfast there which was good, but expensive. Better to go somewhere else to eat. Recommend the Twelve Apostles for breakfast which is an Italian restaurant about 10 minutes walk away.Reception were friendly and helpful, and in fact it was them that recommended the Italian restaurant.The rooms are very clean, well-equipped and generally comfortable. It was very hot at night, and there the air conditioning seem to work. The standard is a double rather than a twin bed, and even though we had specified twins we got doubles. After the first night, they were able to find rooms with twin beds.Location is good for shopping and eating out, but the main sites are not walking distance away. However we found taxis cheaper than in the UK. This is a Warhol themed hotel, with many prints and photos. I liked the prints but could have done with less photos ;-)
