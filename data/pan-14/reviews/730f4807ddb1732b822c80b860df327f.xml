Chose hotel due to location and room rate. Chifley is close to many restaurants, bars, a Coles supermarket and the best gelato shop ever...called Messina. Worth a visit.Hotel was in a good location in relation to the train and bus services (right above the kings cross station)...however be prepared for the sights and sounds of this busy and vibrant area of sydney..it has it's good and not so good points.Room was large and decor pretty good for the price we paid, however the hotel atmosphere was somewhat lacking. The hygeine of the bathroom especially was a bit dodgy..but we survived.The reception was on level two of the hotel, but the entrance was on ground level..a modern area, but very dark, with dingy lighting and nobody at the Concierge desk ..(we saw not one staff member at this so called concierge desk during our entire stay!..which we feel was very dissapointing indeed).Whilst we enjoyed our stay and absolutely loved Sydney we would probably look at different options next time.
