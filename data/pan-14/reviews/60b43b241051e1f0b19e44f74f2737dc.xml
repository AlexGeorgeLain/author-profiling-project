The stay in total was going to be for 6 hours. I made the reservations through starwood and I contacted the hotel directly to make sure that they will accept my credit card for payment. I was sent the authorization form and on it was a place to put down what I believe the charge on the mastercard will be. I had also requested an early check in, which is normally a request that is not guaranteed. My sister arrived just before 9 am, and she went to check in, and she was told that there will be a charge for early check in. I was baffled, why was I not informed when I had precisely asked about the total of the entire stay after requesting an early check in. So I called the hotel directly and spoke to someone in accounting. They had no idea what I was talking about so he said he will call me back. But of course he didn't. So the next day I called back. Again I had to explain my situation. The person again said he has to call me back. I didn't hear back, so I called back that same day but the accounting office was closed. I got a call the next morning explaing to me that because the check in occured before 3 pm there was charge. Before 3 pm? Whats early check in then? I am very disappointed that a starwood property was not completely honest when I made the reservation. I did make the reservation through starwood, but I had contact with the hotel. Nevertheless, even if it is a nice property with nice staff, I will not stay there again or recommend it to anyone. If the charge was previously made clear, then I would not have had a problem.
