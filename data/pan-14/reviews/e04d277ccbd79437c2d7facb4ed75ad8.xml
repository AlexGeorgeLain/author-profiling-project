The breakfast was amazing. I've never seen a joint of pork on a breakfast buffet before.The overall standard was superb. There was a problem with our shower head, but a mechanic was there to fix it within 10 minutes. The Heat Restaurant was a bit dull and soulless for an evening meal and the service was a bit Teutonic. The bus pass was great because the 100 bus which goes along the Unter den Linden to the Brandenburg Gate stopped 200 yards from the hotel. The only difficulty we had was in trying to claim our boat trip. The concierge had no record of it on the Computer and it took a discussion with management to acknowledge our computer print-out showing details of our package. Our impression is that they have so many different deals they are unable to keep track of them. Nevertheless we would definitely stay there again. The location is ideal.
