A short walk from all means of transport. Surprisingly quiet considering it is so close to the hustle and bustle of central Barcelona. The hotel itself was very good and we would have awarded it an excellent if it had been a little warmer. The weather was cold when we visited and a few more degrees of heat would have been nice although it certainly wasn't enough to spoil our time there. The bedrooms are well set out and the bathroom was lovely with a 'proper' bath and shower. Excellent safe (no extra charge) and plenty of clothes storage. We didn't use the restaurant so can't comment but the bar area was comfortable and the drinks were reasonably priced and actually cheaper than some of the bars surrounding it! The staff were very polite, courteous and helpful and the maid service unobtrusive. Whatever time we left, the rooms were always cleaned, tidied and re-stocked with towels before we got back. One whinge - tea and coffee is only provided for your arrival further supplies have to be bought from the room bar/fridge.
