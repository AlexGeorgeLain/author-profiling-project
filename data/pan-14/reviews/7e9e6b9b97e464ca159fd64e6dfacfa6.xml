There is certainly some homelessness in the immediate area, but that's true throughout the city and shouldn't be counted against the Parc.The rooms themselves are big enough and have all the standard amenities you'd expect from a 4* hotel.My only problem was the front desk - surly during check in and unhelpful at other times. For instance, they have an internet connection in the lounge on the second floor which uses pre-paid cards and advertises them. Except they don't actually have any. Front desk's attitude was basically not got any, not our problem, which stinks for a large hotel.
