I was going to my 25th High School Reunion in Manhattan on 11/11/00-we had to take my small, Pekingese dog with us. Sofitel accomodated the dog-the room and bathroom was beautiful-but a little small if one was staying more than 2-3 nights. Fitness room was awesome-each cardio piece had it's own TV. Service was okay-it took us 25 minutes to get our luggage-and the dog was among the checked pieces-also, the valet car parking was a little slow. Still, a wonderful stay!
