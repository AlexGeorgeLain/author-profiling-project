The staff is very attentive but low-key. The hotel is well maintained. The rooms are quiet and well appointed. The location is superb. Overall its a great value. It can take time to get your car if you want it between 10 and 11 AM. We look forward to the completion of repairs that will bring elevator #2 back on line. For those who complained about slow checkout, maybe the hotel should offer checkout through the TV like some other hotels do. Wes, you need to lighten up a little on your reaction to some of these reviews. You can't please everyone, but based on this website, you come awful close to it. Keep up the good work.
