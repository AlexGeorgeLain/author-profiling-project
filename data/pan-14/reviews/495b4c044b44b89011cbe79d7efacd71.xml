I go to New Orleans at least twice a year and I would say this was my favorite hotel so far (and we stay in a different one each time). It's only a half block off of Bourbon (easy to stagger back to). We stayed in two different rooms, both were nice, but a little different. The only problem was there seems to be some kind of steel business next door that is working on the weekdays, so there was a lot of noise (could have been clean up recovery) early in the morning on the work day.
