I've stayed at interstate hotels cleaner than my room! My major complaint was with housekeeping -not only for the dirty room, but because we had left some items behind. They mailed some of the items back home to us (I initiated the call to find the missing items) but they kept the new items I'd purchased in NYC, i.e., all of my items were not returned. They were all in one drawer, so they were not in several locations throughout the room. Somebody's kid is wearing the new school clothes I'd purchased for my son! I wrote two letters - one to the hotel manager, and one to the hotel headquarters - and never received a response.
