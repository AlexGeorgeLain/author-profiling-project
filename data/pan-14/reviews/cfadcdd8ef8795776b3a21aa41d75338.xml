While noise is an issue, you are just off Bourbon Street, I personally had no problem. You don't go to Bourbon Street/French Quarter to sleep. The rooms were clean and basic, but old. The bed was comfortable and the shower had good water pressure (we stayed in 310). The Courtyard is BEAUTIFUL. There was a wedding in the courttyard one night, which was very loud, but it ended at 11 PM. The front desk staff was either very nice and easy to deal with or completely rude depending on the person. The bell men were great and very helpful. The price is also good for the French Quarter, you can't beat the location. My advice is if you are in New Orleans to site see during the day/go out at night, this hotel is a good choice. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing stay, with all the extras, you probably shouldn't stay here.

Within walking distance to Grand Central, Park Avenue, Madison, and 5th Avenue. Also, only a few blocks from the UN. The staff was VERY nice and helpful. Rooms were nice and clean, but basic (but who goes to NYC to sit in a room?). The hotel restaurant had a great breakfast buffet and there is a drug store right next to the hotel so you can get bottled water and midnight snacks. I would recommend staying here.
