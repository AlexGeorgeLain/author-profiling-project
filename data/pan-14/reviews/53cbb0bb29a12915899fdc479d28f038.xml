We loved the Hotel ,although it was a bit far away from places where we wanted to see. We used the valet service most times and found this excellent, the drivers were great and very helpful. We can't speak highly enough of the doorman, come porter Bobby who went out of his way to help us with our tour problems. We had to leave a day early but this was no problem with the desk staff, once again thanks to you all
