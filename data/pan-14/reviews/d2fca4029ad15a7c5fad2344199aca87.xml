However, it was looking at the wall of the next hotel 30 feet away so for $10 a night we upgraded to the 10 th floor and a view of the ocean (between the beach hotels). The room was clean, excellent housekeeping, kitchen facilities were fine (we do much cooking), and we liked the large security safe in the room. We bought some mugs as the cups were too small for a decent cup of tea.There was complimentary wireless Internet in the lobby and the hotel was central to all Waikiki activities. We were concerned with the reviews about the slow elevators but in the week we were there, only once did we wait more than a minute for an elevator.
