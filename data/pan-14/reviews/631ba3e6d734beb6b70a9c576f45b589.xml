A bit of noise from the trams going past, but the sound of the bells being rung is part of SF. The room was fine, really liked the goose-down pillows and soft duvets. try out the pillow menu, but a great idea as a pillow can make or break a good sleep. The bathroom was okay, a bit in need of freshening up though. Scratches on the bath etc. overall a good stay, but nothing spectacular as I was expecting when I saw that it was rated 3rd in SF. I comment on the service or food as we ate out all the time, but they were quite happy for us to check out at 6am due to a tour pick-up. Try the diner up the street. Real chrome and 50s kitsch. overall a nice hotel in a good location.
