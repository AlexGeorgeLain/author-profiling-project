Rooms were of good size, we asked for top floor room which had a bit of a view over the harbour and also turned out to be quiet as well. Comfortable beds, soft and firm pillows allowed good nights sleep, coffee maker, clean bathroom with all the necessary bits and pieces included. Cool bucket supplied and with ice maker and vending machine down the corridor, (mini fridge would be better suited.) Internet access downstairs with 2 computers to allow one to check e mail etc.( free service in the room.) Breakfast was choice of cereals, yoghurts, toast, pastry and choice of 3 hot plates, never any rush and plenty of food. Yes would be nice to have a bar or restaraunt in the hotel but really it is location here that is important, this hotel is minutes away from all the touristy areas with all sorts of eating establishments and with easy acces to public transport. We had a hire car which the valet allowed us to leave at the front door free of charge while we unloaded our cases and checked into the room , then we returned our car to local depot. No need for a hire car in SF, public transport is fun, easy and cheap while public parking is expensive. Shuttle bus to the door should take 30-40 mins and $12-15. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.
