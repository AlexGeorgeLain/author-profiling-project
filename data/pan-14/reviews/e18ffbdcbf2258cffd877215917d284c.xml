Everyone was very helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was very tastefully decorated as was the whole BB. We never needed a car while in Sydney because of the great location of Simpson's. We walked to all the nearby restaruants, to Hyde Park, the botanical gardens and to catch the many ferries. What really made our stay so special was when we had left the Simpson's in a shuttle to the airport. The Simpson's called the shuttle to let them know that my husband had left his carry-on bag containing our passports and boarding passes at the BB. We called when we got to the airport and spoke with Keith Wherry. Keith told us not to worry, he would bring our bag to the airport in time for us to catch our plane. As promised, 20 minutes later, Keith pulls up with my husband's bag. He didn't have to do that, he could have just sent it in a cab, but that's not the way they treat their guests at the Simpson's.Morrisville, PA USA
