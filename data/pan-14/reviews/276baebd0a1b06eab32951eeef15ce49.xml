Its a great hotel and represents great value in a really interesting area of the city. The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character...although very smart. Our room was small but adequate and well kept. The downstairs cafe serves great food, and while we were there there was live music and comedy every single night. The staff were very helpful and friendly and i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays. The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price.

The location is slightly out of the mix of the main tourist sites being situated near Rockefort metro stop, but you can walk there in 10 minutes or get a tube. Its pretty quiet, the rooms are modern and clean, the staff are friendly and helpful and it didn't cost too much cash either. Only piece of advice is on car parking....the entrance is so hard to see and you need to have checked in before you can get in, so have a plan of where to park up to check-in beforehand. If you've got a car wiith you, the location actually works more.....you can get onto the Grand Via simply by turning right out the car park and going 3-4 blocks down. From there you can get anywhere East or West of the city.
