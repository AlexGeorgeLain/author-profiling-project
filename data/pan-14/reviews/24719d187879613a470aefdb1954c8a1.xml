We decided to spend one night at the Seattle Hilton and what a pleasant stay it was. Our standard room was spotless, warm, and comfortable. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly and professional, from the front desk to the housekeepers. This is a lovely property in a convenient downtown location. The only drawback was the parking garage, which has tight spaces and was full to the brim. However, we were very pleased with our stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again, or recommend it to out of town guests.
