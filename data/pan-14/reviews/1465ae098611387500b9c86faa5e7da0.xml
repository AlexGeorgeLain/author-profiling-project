The rooms were clean and the hotel is close to Rue Mouffetard--(incidentally the Cave de la Bourgogne cafe at 144 Rue Mouffetard was great!). There are friendly cafes nearby and the metro is fairly close. The hotel staff were incredibly helpful. I would absolutely consider this hotel for future stays in Paris.
