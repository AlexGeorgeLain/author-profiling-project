Fortunately we were redirected to the Ambassade.Our comfortable room was on the fourth floor overlooking the Herengracht, and it was close to a lift. The staff were most attentive and helpful, and the lobby computer access made e-mail checking a breeze. It would be idle to point out that the staff spoke perfect English, since we couldn't find anyone in Amsterdam who didn't. The surrounding canal area is charming, and a few blocks away on Spuistraat, for example, are shops, inviting sidewalk cafes, and many quality restaurants of all kinds. The hotel is a good starting point for exploring Amsterdam, as many spots such as the Anne Frank Haus are nearby, and tram stops are within a couple of blocks. Do not bring an automobile for all the negative reasons one can imagine.Breakfast at the Ambassade is certainly ample, and we ate at the hotel for two mornings, but at 16 euros a pop, one can have a nearby cafe breakfast and a cappucino at half the price if you choose.We did indeed enjoy our stay, and feel fortunate that we stumbled on what has to be one of the nicer spots in Amsterdam, a Paris with canals. We would certainly return.
