The rooms were a good size and very fresh and modern. We only had breakfast in the hotel but no complaints there. You had a choice of a la carte or buffet. The staff were very friendly. It was ideally situated near the MTR with a road crossing right outside the door. Anyone who knows Hong Kong will know what a boon that is as sometimes you have to walk a long way just to cross the road. All in all a very good place to stay whether on business or pleasure
