From check in to check out the service was impeccable and the room excellent. The location, a five-minute walk from the train station and right next to the historic area of Amsterdam, was outstanding. The room was very large with a desk, flat screen TV and free mini-bar. The architectural details of the building were also impressive lobby area is worth a visit. Denver Mullican, New Orleans

The business center offers free Internet and printing. You have to use the key card to use most of the facilities, including the elevator. There are a number of restaurants on the same block as the hotel many are open late. Denver Mullican, New Orleans

Service is very good, rooms are spacious and the front desk staff is extremely helpful. There is free Internet access in the lobby.
