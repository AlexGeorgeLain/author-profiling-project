I found the staff very willing to serve when approached with respect.? I drink lots of tea and it was never a problem when I fronted up at reception with my mug and tea bag for the staff to get me some boiling water.We had been given a top floor sea view room but a lower floor room was requested and it did not matter that it was a garden view. In fact it was nice to be able to sit out of the direct sun on our balcony.This is a basic hotel so please do your homework before booking.I have traveled all over the world and it is unusual these days to get a double bed but it is easy to check this before you leave home. Honeymooners beware!!!I hope this hotel has not changed much now it is under new management as I hope to return .
