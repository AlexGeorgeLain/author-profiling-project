The Milsons Point subway stop is right across the street.When we checked in, there had been a problem with our reservation and I was upgraded to a suite on the executive level. Wonderfully comfortable room, nice view of the Marina.The staff is helpful with giving directions and addressing guest needs. The hotel is rather hip; however, some of the furniture in the rooms looks a bit worn.Internet access is not free. Morning newspapers, which are promised at check-in, were never delivered. The underground parking is impossible to manuever.I'd definitely stay here again!
