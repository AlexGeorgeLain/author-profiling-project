It was well located as we caught the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma and only had to walk a short distance to the hotel. Then when we went to the cruise terminal we could either catch the shuttle bus - 5 mins from the Piazzale or walk (20 mins).We picked the hotel based on location and did not have expectations of the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was exceptional, the room (we stayed in the superior room, top floor) overlooked the grand canal, and was beautifully furnished. The staff were exceptionally helpful. Breakfast was lovely, and served on their sunny terrace.We wouldn't hesitate recommending this romantic hotel to anyone.
