My husband and I arrived in Florence late one night (flight delayed from Paris) and would have been thankful for a bed of hay in a cow barn, we were so exhausted! Instead, the taxi dropped us at what is surely one of the loveliest hotels in Italy...the Beacci Tornabuoni! The night staff was cheerful and welcoming, our room was a dream (high ceilings, lovely handpainted frescoes on the walls, luxurious bath.) But best of all---the management had given our daughter a key to the room (she was living in Florence at the time) and there our girl was, waiting for us with a delicious snack of local wine and cheese! I mention this to illustrate the family nature of this wonderful place: with all the overly-paranoid security issues these days, they could easily have denied her access to our room before we arrived, but they listened sympathetically to her tale of our travel woes, and agreed to let her in. The convenient location has been praised in other reviews, and I couldn't agree more! The breakfast is plentiful, the little bar so charming (like a library in a private home! My daughter and I had a few drinks there late one lazy afternoon, and had it all to ourselves except for the unobtrusive but attentive waiter).I would never stay anywhere else in Florence!
