The waiters remember your name and what you ordered for breakfast. The bed was sooo comfortable, we almost did not want to wake up in the morning. Also beautiful area and views of the Angel of the Independence!! The Concierge is very knowledgeable and gave us tips for sightseeing. Everyone was just great. Strongly recommend it -- We will certainly go back!!
