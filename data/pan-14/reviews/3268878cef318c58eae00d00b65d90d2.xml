We (my husband and I) just returned from the IC On Nov. 20th from a 7 day stay and I can truly say everything was wonderful. The staff are exceptional and the hotel is kept up morning, noon and night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone interested in staying in a affordable, beautiful hotel right on the beach with anything u could possibly ask for. Rooms are large with a balcony and the grounds are the cleanest I've encountered any where. The Italian restaurant Passagio is fantastic. They have two other restaurants also a Ruth Chris' steak house and a japenese steakhouse. All I can say is that if you stay in the Intercontinental you will not be disappointed, we weren't!
