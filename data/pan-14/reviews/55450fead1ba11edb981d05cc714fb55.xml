Stayed here for one week and couldnt wait to get back to England, it was a Caribbean version of Pontins, infact i have had better holidays at pontins than here. They seem to put all the english customers at the back end of the resort which is a good 15 minutes from the main eating areas and 20 mins from the beach, pathways not lit up very well at night and only one security man for the whole complex. The rooms in the brochure and on the net looked nothing like our little chalet room that was beyond basic. The restaurants had birds pecking at the food and we saw several cockroaches helping themselves to the buffet. We have been to the dominican lots of times and this as to be the worst complex ever. The beach was amazing and plenty of sun loungers but that was the only thing nice about this holiday. I wouldnt def never go back.
