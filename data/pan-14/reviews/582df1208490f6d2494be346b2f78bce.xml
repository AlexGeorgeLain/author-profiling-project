It definitely had the best bed out of all our stays throughout Italy and Madrid. They were kind enough to upgrade us and even brought us complimentary cava and strawberries which was a nice surprise. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and nice. Slightly small, but not too bad. It was convenientlly located near the Ramblas and a metro station. We walked everywhere from here. I would definitely stay here again. Definitely great value.
