The price is right and the restaurants great. We opted for the extra money for the breakfast and cocktails. This was a bargain as well. The breakfast is sumptuous and provides everything you could want for breakfast no matter your country of origin. The cocktail area with a few hors d'oeuvres was also nice and worth the money. We ate at the hotel restaurant two nights and had one lunch in the noodle restaurant--all excellent. The people at the front desk were very nice as were the concierge staff. One man even agreed to have our taxi driver keep in cell contact with him because of the language barrier. The rooms were good size and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms roomy. My husband is an architect and he was very impressed with the interiors. We walked to the Forbidden City a couple of times and Wangfujing Street is near by. If you are homesick there's a Starbucks in the cul-de-sac. If you need to call from the US we found the English to be good and the arrangements to be just as we requested.
