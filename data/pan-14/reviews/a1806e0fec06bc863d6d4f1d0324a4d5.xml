It was very easy to get to sites and was a happening area at night. Our room faced the street which was a little noisey at times, but the view was great! Our room had everything we needed - beds were so comfortable and the bathroom had everything we needed. Breakfast was included in our rate and was simple. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. I don't think you'll find a better deal in Berlin.
