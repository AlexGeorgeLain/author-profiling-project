The subway station is easily accessible, but doesn't have escalators near the exits close to the hotel- which made dragging all our luggage around a bit of a chore at some points. The hotel is easy to find once you've found it before but when you're heading there for the first time- definitely have the directions handy. It's a walk from the station, but not bad. People in the area are very likely to be helpful if you approach them, or are likely to approach you and ask if you need help if you look lost enough (as was the case with us). As you'll see when you get there, the area is a big business area, although there's a cafe or two and a few convenience stores close to the hotel. The staff speaks english well, and the room, while small, was big enough (we had 3 people, 2 double beds). Internet access was free and worked. We also had a small refrigerator and hot water pot.Overall, the experience lived up the apparent reputation of a decent place for the money- decent location and a pretty good rate.

We stayed at Ochanomizu for three days.We had previously had some frustrating experiences dragging all of our stuff around while trying to find other hotels, so we determined that it might be best to just take a taxi to the hotel from the station instead of attempting to find it on our own... well it turns out it's just a little down the street from the station, so it was a very very short taxi ride. I'd recommend trying to find it on foot first unless you have a very significant amount of luggage (although a word of warning: the closest subway exit is a fairly lengthy flight of stairs, and there is no escalator. On a less related note, at the top of those stairs there's a Tully's Coffee, and their Honey Milk Latte is delicious). The lobby of the hotel is nice, and there are a few staff members who speak at least a little English. We arrived before check in time, and there were no problems with leaving our bags there so we could go out for a while (they tagged them and took them to a room behind the counter). Overall, it's actually a really convenient location. There's a 7-11 directly across the street, and te subway station is very much in the middle of things, and is connected by tunnel to a different station, so you can get to a few different lines pretty easily. I don't think we explored the area around the hotel all too much, but there are a few different restaurants and convenience stores.I forget which side of the building we were on, but either way I wouldn't expect a great view of anything from the window (we could see the 7-11 quite well). Our room was a double, for 2 people, and was small but reasonable. Somewhat surprisingly, there wasn't a way to get internet access in the room. There was a small LCD TV mounted on the wall, and a desk. The bathroom was rather small but clean. The bed was pretty big and comfortable but-for those affected by allergies: the pillows and comforter are feathers! I'm allergic to down, so we tried to explain this to the staff (the person who knew more english wasn't there at the time so I used japanese) but it turns out those are the only pillows they have. They did however offer to give us non-feather blankets, which were brought to the room shortly after, so we did what we could and used those as a pillow. If you're really allergic to feather bedding, it'd probably be a good idea to mention this to them prior to arrival, maybe if it happens often enough they can pick up a few synthetic fiber ones. (Note: I didn't have a problem with feather bedding anywhere else I stayed while in Japan). One of my favorite things about this hotel: there's a green tea dispenser in the hallway! It also dispenses hot water, but having a constant supply of (really quite) hot green tea (from real leaves too) is pretty nice (although there was still the usual hot water pot in the room anyway I believe). Seemed quite appropriate for a hotel named 'ochanomizu', tea water.Overall, considering the location the rate was fairly reasonable. Because of this, we'll probably stay there again. Except next I'll probably have to go pillow shopping first...
