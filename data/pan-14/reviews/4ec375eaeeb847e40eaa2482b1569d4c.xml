We were greeted Tony at checkin who was always friendly helpful at the front desk. Our room was clean tidy with a huge ensuite, big TV, iron, safe ceiling fan. The area can feel a bit dodgy at night, but we felt safe going to from the hotel. The only negative is that the complimentary breakfast isn't very exciting, so we went to 'Dottie's True Blue Cafe' nearby enjoyed delicious breakfasts there.
