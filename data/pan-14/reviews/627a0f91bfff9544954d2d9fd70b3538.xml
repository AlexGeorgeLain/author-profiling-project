The water park kept the boy's busy for most of the day and kept us out of what was a old tired room. The facility itself was good, the staff and every employee we needed to encounter treated us with respect. Spending a lot of time in the water park I did notice some problems and the first being people being there that had no business being there, my impression was that only guest that were book at the hotel are allowed to use the water park. Over all I would recommend this hotel for people with kids who need to burn off some energy but would think twice if I were staying there alone or as a couple. The room we were in was outdated with 60's decor and some carpeting that was suspect at best.

The desk staff were a little aluff but helpful, the welcome pack was a surprise and kept our grandson with munchies for the evening. We also received a couple of coupons for free appetizers and beer which were very welcome and unexpected. They are working on the road in front of the hotel but it's easy to maneuver. I will use this property again when flying out of Phoenix.
