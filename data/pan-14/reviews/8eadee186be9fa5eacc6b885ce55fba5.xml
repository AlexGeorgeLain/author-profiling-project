It is one of the best hotels in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and you can get a room for $95.00 until Jan. 5th (and around $220-50 breaks for AAA members). We have stayed at the Phoenician, The Hyatt at Gainey Ranch, The Wigwam, etc. Of all those hotels, we often prefer to go to The Tapatio because: 1. wonderfully friendly staff who go out of their way to say hello or to help you out. This includes the check-in staff, the hotel room-service delivery people, the gift shop people and the whole assortment of the people at the golf course (they could consider hiring at least one to look as if they had an inkling that women can be pros, too). 2. The rooms are outstanding but not huge. There are two rooms in each suit. The first is, of course, the living room. That is separated from the bedroom by an ingenious systems of doors on either side of the bathroom (The bathroom has a pass-through from the living room to the and mirror on one side, toilet and bath on the other with a door.) which is between the two that closes between the living room and the bathroom and one that closes between the bathroom and the bedroom; this allows people in one room to close off the other room but to still use the bathroom. The rooms are newly read the earlier comment about what the writer thought were unattractive color schemes. Those colors are the keeping up to of the resorts we have stayed at in the greater Phoenix area, have begun to use similar colors. The beds have feather pillows and feather quilts. There is a wet bar and refrigerator in the living room. 2 wide screen first! Adequate lighting by each side of the bed. It is true that not all rooms are created equal. Some rooms have great views (such as in the main building on the right view is of delivery trucks all day so avoid those rooms). It is a hotel which is built on hillsides (which is part of its charm). If walking is a problem (as noted in one of the earlier reviews) request a room down below. 3. There are several small restaurants and two larger ones. One of the two larger ones is all paneled with mahogany and is very handsome. Good food, reasonably priced for a resort. Great bar. Friendly atmosphere. Then there is their very slick Point of with terrific views of Phoenix/Scottsdale. The restaurant has gotten great reviews from food critics. Pricey but that is what a gourmet restaurant costs. 4. You want pools? got pools. A huge water-wonderland set up with slides, etc. Two smaller pools nearer to the main part of the busy. One on top of the hill. Fitness center. And here is something outstanding: the hotel does not charge the usual $10-$12 a day I have come to hate at all hotels. You can buy a special certificate for $2.50 a day for various uses of resort you have to. Right there you save at least $70.00 a week.5. GOLFERS! Listen up. The course is terrific. It is kept in first-class condition (with the exception of the 2nd sure why they attended to that). The course has been called Phoenix areas best kept staff was very accommodating. The course climbs up and up until the 9th (at which point you are 3 miles from the clubhouse) where you can see for miles in either direction. There are some pretty tricky holes where doglegs, water and thick desert flora abound. Deep traps. Undulating greens, Fun. I paid to be this upbeat about the hotel! I just think it is great place. It going to all things to all give it try. I think you will be pleased.
