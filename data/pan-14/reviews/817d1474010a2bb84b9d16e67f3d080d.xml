One can walk to most of the big attractions and there are plenty of good bars, shops and restaurants close by. Our first floor standard room was comfortable, although we did little more than sleep there. The staff was very helpful. My wife loved the free breakfast, but I would have liked a better cereal choice and less cigarette smoke.
