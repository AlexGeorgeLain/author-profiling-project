If you want to get somewhere at a time when the shuttle is not running all you have to do is ask and they will put it on for you, we were picked up from the airport at about 11pm on arrival and were dropped at the subway station at about 6am on the day of our departure.The hotel was very nice and clean, there was a free breakfast in the morning and there was internet access though it cost about $7 per half hour. There was also a small gym in the hotel for use of residents. There are no restaurants around the hotel but there is a bowling alley which offers take away pizza.The only problem with this hotel was the shuttle is sometimes overcrowded and not everyone can get on, however it is never long before the next one comes along.

The hotel was very nice, the rooms were a good size and great value for money. Also the view from our room out over the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge was amazing. Only downside was the car parking charge of $25 a day. Otherwise this was a great hotel and would definitely recommend.
