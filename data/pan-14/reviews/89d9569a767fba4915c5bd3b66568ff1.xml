Our room in the back was huge, light and lovely, though the bath was very small. The air conditioning was barely adequate. The front desk people were polite, but not particularly helpful. They would do nothing to help when my wife was too ill to go out to dinner and we wanted to bring dinner in, though a kind bellman got us a table and dishes. While the location is convenient, the area in the vicinity of the hotel is dull, with very few restaurants and shops. The Duomo is only a 5 minute walk, however. The price we paid, 205 euros, seemed high given the limited service at the hotel. The square was lovely to look at but mostly quiet. We did not experience it as seedy. We would return to this hotel and recommend it, but would check other possibilities first.
