The Travel office was really good, because we were able to book a few tour throughout bali with them.The service was excellent and the staff were very freindly. The poolside bar came in very handy, they even came out to the back pool to send us food and drinks. the breakfast was also very good each morning.Kuta square is a fair walk (especially in the heat) but its not hard to get a taxi as they wait out the front of the hotel for you to come out, and thats on a 8,000rp trip which is nothing. otherwise you can just walk around the corner and your can see the shops in legain which are just as good.The location is really good as its located on the beach, and if you want to go for a quick swim its no stress to get back quickly to the hotel.Papa's cafe was excellent. Me and my girldfriend went there most nights as it was easy to get to and the food and staff were very nice. from Papa's you could go anywhere you want from there.This hotel was just what we were looking for.I have some photo's but i will put them up a bit later on.
