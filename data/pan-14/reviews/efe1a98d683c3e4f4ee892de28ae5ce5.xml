We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never received any bad or indifferent service from the staff. On the contrary the staff has always gone out of their way to make our holidays memorable with their friendliness and kindness.As for the food, there was never any cause for complaint and the service in the a la carte restaurant was always efficient, I understand why there are reports mentioning the slowness or rudeness of the staff in this area. Furthermore if there was nothing on the menu that took our fancy, the chef was always willing to prepare something special for us.On the evening of my 70th birthday, the hotel prepared a lovely secluded table on the beach for us to celebrate in style and gave him some traditional Balinese clothes to wear to make the occasion very special. I would also recommend the Spa and the treatments which are professional and very good value. The Spa has several private treatments rooms with outdoor Balinese baths and showers, heavenly!!We shall definitely return again and regularly recommended this hotel to our friends and family.
