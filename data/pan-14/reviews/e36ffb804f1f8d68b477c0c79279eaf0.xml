It is secluded, quaint, and clean town. In the middle of it is the Silvermine Hotel, facing the beach. The staff is quite friendly, helpful and try to accomodate you. The food is so-so. The room is tiny but sufficient and the little things they provide for the guests are plenty. The other building was still being renovated and we were billeted in a separate building still w/ great ocean or mountain view.Sometimes one does not have to stay in a grand place to feel rich.It's definitely a serene respite from the hustle and bustle of Hongkong and Kowloon.
