The staff was very friendly, the rooms were great and the location was just wow. The Townhall Cityrail station is just a few minute's walk away, the Monorail station is even closer, awesome malls are just on the doorstep, and many major attractions are within walking distant (the Rocks and Darling Harbour). The only thing that I wasn't entirely satisfied with was the breakfast. It was fine, but not great- well, I guess that's because it's free.We'd like to thank a member of the staff at the concierge. Our taxi ran late on the day we left because of the traffic, and we really appreciated the fact that he truly made an effort to ensure that we could leave as soon as possible. We didn't quite catch his name, but Swissotel should be proud that they have such dedicated staff.
