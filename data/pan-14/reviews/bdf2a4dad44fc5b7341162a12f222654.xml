Yes, many of the rooms are on the small side (especially compared with the USA) but big enough unless you have lots of luggage. Useful list of recommended nearby restaurants in the hotel room brochure. Our favourite was the Haesje Claes - the menu included in the brochure shows only a tiny sample of what's on offer there. One tip: think carefully before buying an IAmsterdam card - you will need to be pretty busy to make it worthwhile, and nearly all the main sites are within walking distance.
