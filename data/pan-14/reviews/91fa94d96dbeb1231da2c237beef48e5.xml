The price is spectacular. The location is excellent .The staff is like family.The breakfast is personal and friendly.We Stayed four nights . We have been to venice twice before . Never again will we make the mistake of staying near The Plaza San Marco . This is the real venice . The restaurants in the area are better . There are real people here. For the first time we explored all the islands that make up venice and found many new sights and places . Including local restaurants and shops. It made us want to come back more often.And to top all that my wife left her 2 KT Diamond earings and three rings and they arrived at my home in the USA as promised.They should clone these guys .I have a feeling I'm going to have trouble getting a reservation here again . But I will try!!!!!!!!

However they are the best two star hotel . Meaning the room was very clean and was cleaned every day as was the entire hotel everything was very clean and neat . The air conditioner was as cold as you desired . At night there was no noise ,we were on the third floor. The front desk staff was very friendly and prompt. The location is excellent for walking thru old san juan or to the cruise terminal.You are in an ideal location.They even have an empty mini refrigerator .There is all you need ,no luxury or bellhop.The owner is a type of philosopher poet and there are samples of his thoughts in the room to view .Great Karma at this place . You can tell they are always looking to make sure all is well.Sort of like living in a condo with a good front desk.
