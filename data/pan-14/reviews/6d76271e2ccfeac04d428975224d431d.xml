The service was very friendly, and we had a decent time overall. However, we had a few problems--each minor, but collectively annoying--during our stay:1) We arrived to find stains on our sheets and no soap in the bathroom. And because we had arrived late, we had to change the sheets ourselves.2) The walls between us and our neighbors were surprisingly thin. At one point we could hear the local newscast on the TV next door as if it were showing in our room.3) This was the kicker--it happened to rain on our last night there, and all the water off the roof drained right onto a metal windowsill outside our window. Needless to say, we slept very poorly, even after housekeeping gave us some earplugs. If it rains, DO NOT STAY ON THE 4TH FLOOR.Interestingly, when I complained to the front desk, she said many of the guests had made similar complaints, and that the hotel management was pushing for a renovation. I won't be staying again until they do.
