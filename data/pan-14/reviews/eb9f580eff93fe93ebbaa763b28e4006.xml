Compared to some other hotels in London, which are as expensive (Thistle hotels for example), the Chesterfield has real class. The decor is really special.Rooms are lovely (although quite small), and the staff is wonderful (they are all well trained and focused on customer satisfaction).The only small thing which is wrong is that they charge for each little bottle of water (33cl) they put in the room, and you don't know anything about it until you pay your bill. Can be a nasty shock if you stay for a few days!I strongly recommend their afternoon tea, their scones are fantastic!Bar and restaurant are expensive: for a GT, and for a glass of champagne... but what else can you expect in Mayfair ?Overall an excellent hotel. Will definitely go back for my next stay in London.
