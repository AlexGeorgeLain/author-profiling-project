The rooms are very clean and I loved the walk-in closet! The bed and linens were comfortable.Even though we did not try the pillow menu, it is a great feature. (the pillows we had on the bed were perfect for us). Also, the option to rent (very inexpensive) a foot or bath massager is a good idea. Those hills are killers !We were on the 13th floor (no bad luck here !) and had a nice view toward Union Square. With the window open and the ceiling fan on, our room was ok for temperature ... It was quite warm the week we were there. Remember that Sept Oct is summer in San Fran. The staff was all friendly and very helpful. From storing our luggage when we arrived early to buying muni passes and answering all our questions on directions etc... Thanks to all for the great service.All the little touches made the Chancellor a perfect choice... the coffee, tea, cookies, apples in the lobby... the candy and rubber ducky in the room ~~ All made us feel welcome !
