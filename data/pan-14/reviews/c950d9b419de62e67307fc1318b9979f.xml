Let me explain, we stayed 4 nights and upon arrival we stated that we wanted to see a traditional ladies dance and gamelan music, a Kecak trance danse, and if possible a ceremony. Everybody was all smiles and all yes yes, so we booked a car to go and see the Kecak trance danse, when we got there it was all dark and we met closed doors, the driver called the hotel to be told it was closed because there was a ceremony at Monkey Forest. So not only did we miss out on the Kecak danse but we also miss out on the ceremony !!! The front desk is hopeless, the people are nice, they smile to you but it is not enough. In the questionnaire we received there were questions about the front desk, the concierge, etc, all this is totally inexistant as is the managing director, we never ever saw his face. The food was very good indeed and so was the spa but as travelers we would also like to see the outside world and I am afraid to say that we did not receive the informations we wanted.
