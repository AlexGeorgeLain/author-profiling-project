I wanted the hawaiian experience with all the fun stuff of Waikiki beach and that was exactly what we got.First of all, we booked the least expensive room (garden room) and they put us on the fourth floor of the original building overlooking the pool and beach...fabulous views. The room was good sized with huge ceilings and average bath, walk in closet, gorgeous floral wallpaper and king sized comfy bed. Like being in a bed and breakfast,. The gardens of the hotel were serene and relaxing to return to after spending the day shopping (minutes away) or on the beach. Lets face it, there are crowds at Waikiki beach and on the street, and the Hotel and its gardens were perfect after all the crazy people.Mai Tai bar was fun, we ate there at least five times. The actual beach and water was to die for, definately the best on Waikiki. My husband surfed right off the shore and had a great time.We also ate at Dukes and Chucks right next door and both experiences were great.I am not sure what all the complaining about this place is, because we were there during the Don Ho memorial (20,000 people on the beach) and still had a fabulous time at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel...and definately will be back!
