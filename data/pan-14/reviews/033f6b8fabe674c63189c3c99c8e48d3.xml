It was a 10 minute walk from the train station. This particular hotel does not offer lotion, so bring your own and they also run out of face towels. Housekeeping is not that great, we had to go behind them to clean things off. It's an older building and the ceilings in the room are low, so I wouldn't suggest anyone over 6 feet to stay in the executive suite and it also does not offer a bathtub but a huge shower. But this hotel is centrally located to everything and I would stay there again. I would also not suggest using there internet from the room, it may not connect , but they do have a business office on the first floor. Jose the Concerige was very nice and accomodating and made our stay very nice.
