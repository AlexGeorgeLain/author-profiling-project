Buy a tourist card for the metro and buses at the airport station.The hotel. We had a room on the first floor. It was a reasonable size but had no view to speak of. Be warned one of the rooms is adjacent to the breakfast room so everyone in the hotel walks past this door. Room was a little on the small size but clean and obviously recently redecorated. All fixtures and fittings are of the ultra modern design as are the colours used. Definately a matter of taste and I must admit rather an aquired taste.Breakfast was buffet style and was very good catering for the health concious and the not so...Sausages and bacon etc.Overall at good hotel. If you can put up with the decor (see sites for pics) the hotel can be highly recommended, especialy for it's location.
