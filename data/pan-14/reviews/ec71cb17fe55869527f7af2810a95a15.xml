We had a very nice suite and our only complaint was that the sofa was not comfortable. The bedding was wonderful, the bathroom was large and beautiful. We had a tub with a shower though most rooms do not. Our room had no closed closet but had a nice separate open dressing area with enough storage space. Service was attentive from checking in to departure.Ordering coffee from room service is very expensive but there are lots of places near the hotel including Starbucks and Au Bon Pain. The location is wonderful for walking to Central Park, Fifth Avenue shopping, and theater. We had a summer weekend rate which was very reasonable.
