The location of the hotel was excellent...Nike Village was set up in Union Square as was the start line. Even though the hotel was booked solid, probably due to the Oracle conference as well, our request of adjoining rooms was granted. All the staff we had contact with were so friendly and helpful. The free use of the computer was welcomed as we were able to do web check-in. Our rooms were great and we loved the pillow menu...also the fact the blanket was in between two sheets. We had breakfast most days in the hotel restaurant and it was very good food and service. Our only disappointment was that we did not get a chance to meet Wes Tyler...our shuttle arrived before he could get to the lobby. Oh well, maybe next time... if we return to San Francisco, we will definately stay at the Chancellor.
