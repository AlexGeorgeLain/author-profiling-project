I like this place mainly as the rooms are smart and modern (lots of glass walls etc) and the whole hotel has a good feel to it. Not too large. Staff are friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet is well stocked and varied. both the rooms I had enjoyed views of the point. the location has its advantages and disadvantages - it's not exactly lively where it is. Not much around bar an expensive small shopping mall and a couple of restaurants - but being out of town could be a good thing. The office we were going to was in central and this was only 15 mins in a taxi.
