The location is to my mind, perfect - the Rodin Museum, Ecole Militaire and of course the view of the Eiffel tower. The rooms are very well decorated, if a bit small, the bath tubs are deep and shower strong, and best of all there is air conditioning. What I also like is the location in the proximity of the Rue Cler Market, with all the lovely stalls with fruits, veggies, and meats and the restaurants many of which are patronised by French people. With the Metro stop nearby you can get to anywhere very quickly. There is a bus that you can get near the hotel that goes along Rue St. Dominique and gets you to other areas of Paris.
