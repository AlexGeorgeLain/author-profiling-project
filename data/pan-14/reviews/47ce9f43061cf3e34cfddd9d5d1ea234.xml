Given that it was a long weekend and we got a good rate, hotel was ok. It is a little bit like poking your way around a maze at times, to get to our room we had to go through a few corners, outside, more corners, lift, outside (thought we were lost as there is little signage to rooms) through a fire door to find a hallway, outside again, another hallway, then at last, our room. Rooms are small (as expected) but very clean which is all we wanted for the night. We were told we were 'upgraded'.. I think an upgraded room must simply have bunk beds as well as a double. Room was very noisy at night, we got in at about 1am and it was a saturday night, windows could use some glazing. However, after a while I did sleep quite soundly (or was that the 6 champagnes I had?) either way, it was a little less than expected I must say, but the staff were helpful and friendly. I had been told the room would be read at 12 when I booked, arrived early after a long drive at 11.30 hoping it would be ready but was happy to wait. We were told that the room could be done within 15 minutes... half an hour later we were told it would be done before two but could put our things in the room whilst the cleaner was there. She knew nothing of us leaving our things, told us they would be safe and would lock the door once she finished cleaning the room. We arrived after lunch, to our very clean room, with the door ajar. Wasn't happy about that. What can I say, there were two cleaners employed to work on a long weekend... However, our stay was budget, which was all we were after. Next time though, Id say we will back at the Sofitel. Ps... the elevator was still out of order...
