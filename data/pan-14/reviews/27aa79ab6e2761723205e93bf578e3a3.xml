Maybe not A 5 star? certainly 5 star price even with a discount but for this kind of money I want more than this, and know I can, and have got more from 3 stars.The gym is dire, decrepit, and moribund! No pool, no sauna, no anything.Not very likely to return.

It is very clean, the rooms are good, and it seems very well managed, but its German so that is no surprise!The food is excellent both the evening variety which is basic pub-grub taken in the bar and breakfast which is exceptional in choice and value!Can I complain about anything then?Yes the advertised gym is rubbish, and of the two saunas on site one was broken and locked up, while the other was heated to 40 degrees, useless in the extreme.Other than that it was fine.

I wrote last week about all Holiday Inn Express being the same except for staff, which is true.This is a gem, lovely people and good food.Very clean, well managed hotel.The big thing for me, although it may sound daft, was to arrive later than planned, drained of all energy and knowing the hotel did not have a restaurant and I faced marching off into the German night to find something. Imagine my delight when I discovered they did Pizzas at the bar, and very big ones at very good, like prices.I loved it!
