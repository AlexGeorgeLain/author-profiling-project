However, we needn't have worried. The hotel was great - the room was just like in the pictures, and was great value for the rate.The rooms were small - but that's how things are in Paris. But the room we had was clean, with a good bathroom.The hotel staff were very friendly and spoke great English.As other reviewers have mentioned, I'd definitely get breakfast at one of the nearby cafes.

We paid a little more for a upgraded room - and it was worth the extra.Breakfast was good, you get a decent flat-screen TV, and the location gives you easy, quick access to the very centre of London.We've been disappointed with other London hotels, but this was a refreshing change. We'll be staying here again in the future.
