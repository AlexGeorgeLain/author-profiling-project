I had come to expect large rooms and little service from the brand, but this was not the case; Bellman, knowledgeable front desk staff, a decent gym, and a nice pool were all perks. The free cocktail hour was a nice touch and as long as not expecting the Ritz, this place has it all. I was there with about 15 colleagues for an event, and while a few of them complained about some maintenance issues, no one felt that the issues went unresolved. We all work with and stay in hotels for a living, and felt safe, well taken car of, and in fact, took the opportunity to relax and the bar and pool at the end of our long days (usually we shower and go to bed).The made to order breakfast counter was nice (though a little confusing wait staff and food wraps around a corner), but was tasty and a nice place for everyone to meet in the morning.All in all, it got high marks and will be were we stay from now on in Phoenix.

I recently spend a week at the St Francis on business; It was a fright from the moment I got to my floor. The doorman, front desk staff, and bell staff were attentive, but didn't warn me about my room... It was on a newly renovated floor that smelled of mothballs (I was told it was the new carpet), the whole 11th floor smelled so my window (which opened) was of little help. The bell staff that escorted me to my room noticed immediately that the room was not made up properly and left to collect the towels, robe, and missing pillow. The amenities were less then I would expect, I've received better at a Hampton Inn. They were happy to press my suits, but were unable to shine my shoes. Housekeeping skipped my room twice during my stay, and the hotel never offered an apology; only a they'll be right up. All in all, it was a beautiful hotel, but the room was far too small (albeit a old hotel) for the price and the door banged into the bed when I opened it.For the money, stay at the ritz or four seasons...
