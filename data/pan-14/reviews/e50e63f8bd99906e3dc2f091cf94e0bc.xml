Before you decide to stay on the Zocalo, consider this: Sounds echo around the plaza and the Aztec drummers/dancers perform from 10:00 - 10:00 making it difficult to take a siesta. Other than that, we had a wonderful 4 day stay. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and switched from Spanish to English and back easily (we speak Spanish). The 6th floor terrace restaurant is a must even if you don't stay at the hotel - fantastic views although you will find more exciting food elsewhere. Have the $10 breakfast buffet or, later, coffee or a drink. You will see the cathedral up close, the volcanos, and the action in the plaza. We decided to spend the exta money and had a somewhat nice 5th floor suite that was more like a loft with large windows on 2 sides and a great view of the Zocalo. Service and attention were great. Some rooms have windows over a busy street (5 de mayo) and others have windows into a light/ventelation shaft. Overall, a pleasant hotel in a great (although noisy) location.
