Stayed here twice , first time on New Years Eve 2004 and then in October 2005 and it was absolutely amazing both times, the location is second to none, views from the bedrooms are amazing, its right beside shopping, theatres and tube stations. Loved every minute of staying there, the bar is gorgeous and relaxing while still being very trendy..the breakfast buffet is out of this world and the staff are unbelivably friendly and accommodating, couldnt reccommend the place enough
