This was definitely not a pleasure trip. I chose Hotel Renew after reading TripAdvisor and it was the perfect choice! The property is just as attractive as portrayed and the sense of calm and peace mid all the craziness that can be Honolulu was golden! The staff more than live up to their reputation for kindness to and care of their guests, Robert and Jay in particular. They were very sensitive to our circumstances and went out of their way constantly to make sure we had everything we needed. I look forward to returning for a vacation visit.
