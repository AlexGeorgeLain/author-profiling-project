Upon arrival at the Hotel we were greeted by a very friendly and helpfull lady on recetion, the hotel is charming,very clean,exceedes it's 3 stars has lovely rooms with lovely furniture ,glass chanderliers and richly coloured bed linen.bathrooms wer nice and clean, we had a side room you could hear the sound of the boats and chatter on the street in the morning it had a nice buz about it and was not noisy at night.The continental breakfast was very good eat as much as you like. The location was brillant next to waterbus stops.walk over the scalzie Bridge cheap coffe shop stand up like locals 2 euros. cant find any thing negative to say venice is wonderfull, used tourist 72 hour pass to get all over, burrano brill, Lido and torcello. book now dont hesitate.
