I only arrived there at 11PM, but it was no hassle finding the hotel from Central Station. I was booked into a single room, which was quite small but that was no problem. It seems though that the single rooms are located at the back of the hotel and you have no view at all. It's no problem at all though as most of the time you spend exploring the city and then you don't care about the view. The hotel and room itself was very clean and the staff is just fantastic.The Hotel also offers free WiFi, which I didn't expect for the price that I paid. If you compare this to other small budget hotels in the area, this hotel is a gem. It's no wonder that I needed to book this hotel quite a while in advance as this is value for money. The location can't be any better and the whole of Amsterdam can be visited on foot from here. It's really just a hop away from everything Amsterdam has to offer.
