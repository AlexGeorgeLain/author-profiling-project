It was hard getting someplace for the May 1 holiday weekend, and this was one of the few choices.I had an executive room with good minibar and soaking tub in the small bathroom. Having traveled extensively in Europe, I find a soaking tub a true luxury, even if it's not a luxus hotel. The side facing Storkowerstrasse is quieter than the other and I was at the end of the hallway and far away from the elevator. There's golden oldie music in the hallways and elevator that you can't hear inside your room. Sometimes it annoyed me, but often I found the 80s tunes a hilarious trip back in time.The room was cheerful and hip and I enjoyed my stay. I didn't realize right away that the arrow controls by the door were for the exterior light-damping window shades, so learn from my ignorance! :-). I've stayed elsewhere in Berlin and though this is not a scenic part of the city per se (though elsewhere in Prenzlauer Berg is hip and lovely), you get a feel for the old East Berlin which i find very suggestive, stimulating and intriguing as a writer. And the trips I made from there to Kreuzberg and back were really fascinating.The hotel food was good, though breakfast merely average. Staff was helpful whether I spoke German or English, though perhaps somewhat more so with the former. Cabs come amazingly quickly when called by the front desk.A special treat: a few doors down is a Bulgarian restaurant. Good food at reasonable prices.
