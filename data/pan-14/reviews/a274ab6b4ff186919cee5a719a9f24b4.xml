We also had a rather complicated reservation as two rooms were booked one way and another room was booked differently. We arrived at noon (three hours before check-in) and not only did they easily link all the reservations, we were checked in and placed in rooms directly next to each other. It was a refreshingly quick and efficient check-in. I went in all three rooms after check-in to make sure they were the bed types we had requested, and everything was fine. The only thing I noticed was that some rooms are slightly larger than others, but this can be seen in the building maps as the building is larger toward the center, and narrower at the end. Even if getting a smaller room, I would not have thought anything of it. Our room had a slight view of the Bay Bridge, but was nothing spectacular. I did like the floor to ceiling windows and found the (what seemed to be) newly renovated room to be nice. Probably the biggest bonus to this hotel is the location. It's in the middle of all the action: Chinatown, Financial District, Embarcadero Center (mall), and only a couple blocks from the Ferry Plaza and Embarcadero. The location alone is worth it here let alone that it's a nice hotel.Also, as noted in many previous posts, parking is significantly steep at this hotel (as it is at most hotels around the city). I followed someone else's suggestion and parked at 1 Embarcadero Center (literally across a two lane street) for $32 dollars a day. This was a fine option and the walk was minimal at most.Pros:-Location, Location, LOCATION-Nice rooms-Good check-in and pleasant staffCons:-Not the best view?-Parking is expensive
