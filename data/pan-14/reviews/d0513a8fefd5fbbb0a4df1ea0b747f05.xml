Gorgeous architecture, landscape was immaculate, pool is magnificent (should have its own zip code) and the beach is pretty. Rooms are immaculate and modern. Seriously, you will not find a prettier resort in Punta Cana.BIGGEST CON: This is two part: (1) The food varied from Not bad to Pretty Good. Nothing terrible nothing amazing. After Seven Days I wanted to eat somewhere else. The Buffet is OK. The Grill is OK. Passions and the Asian Fusion portion of Bana (EHHH) . Vento and the Tepinyaki were both fun and enjoyable. However, I never had the desire to go back to a restaurant a second time. (2) The Vibe. Maybe because my wife and I are active people but the vibe was a little laid back for my liking. We definitely enjoy a more uptempo vibe (think Club Med). We tried everything (played volleyball, soccer, sailing, kayaking, etc) but not many people were into being active. I can only lay in the sun for so many it was a relaxing vacation. The staff is very nice and helpful. Watch out for the obnoxious who seem think their all inclusive vacation includes berating staff members (Seriously. I am a New Yorker and embarrassed how some of us act). If you come here you will be happy with a relaxing stay at a beautiful resort.P.S. The resort was at capacity but it never felt that way. I could write a whole lot more about this place (all of which has been said before) but I thought just hit a couple of highlights. Finally, I would not come back here a second time. Not because I did not have a good vacation, which I did, there was nothing special about this place. There are too many parts of the world I want to see first.
