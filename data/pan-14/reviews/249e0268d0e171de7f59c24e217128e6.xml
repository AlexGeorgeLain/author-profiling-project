Still wonderful boutique hotel with welcoming and efficient staff, clean and stylish rooms. Although we havent got just as good room as last time, it is still quite nice, especially by parisian standards. Applauds to the designer, again.What is new as compared to last visit - a restaurant opened just across a little street, called Madame Shawn. Wonderful, loungy, yummy (yet adopted to european taste unless you ask for special spicieness!) thai restaurant. Highly recommend, especially for those willing to try something extra to escargots or just lazy or tired enough to go too far out.Still high five to Hotel Duret, two years have passed, but it still remains our address in paris. Thanks to staff!!!
