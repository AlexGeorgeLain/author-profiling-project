We have just arrived back in England from Boston and three nights at this hotel.I have always trusted Tripadvisors comments as we travel quite extensively, but were they wrong this time!As soon as we walked into the foyer I could tell what we had let ourselves in for, black and grey was the greeting, it continued in the lift, into the passagway, yes, grey carpet, grey walls.Into the room, grey walls and carpet, a huge mirror greeted us, 6'high x over 5' wide, wow!, however, the tiny wardrobe, only 4' high a 12 wide and contained a fold-up chair and an ironing board was totally useless..Nowhere to store clothes, so our luggage had to placed on the floor, it could not go under the bed because the minimilistic moron who designed the room had boxed the underside out so it looked pretty, but, again, totally useless.The bedside lights were on a dimmer on the wall which no-one explained, we had to guess, they did not adjust heightwise so we had to turn the head of the light which was in our faces when we were reading.There were two large windows, with charcoal grey blinds, obviously no curtains.The shower was grey slate walls, and dark quarry tiled floor.The Lounge was grey, cream vinyl diamonds on the walls, and guess what colour the carpet was?If you want to wake up in a morning and know what living in a prison cell is like, stay here!I simply cannot understand how owners of a hotel can ignore the absolute basics of travel, i.e. comfort and practibility, this dump has neither.
