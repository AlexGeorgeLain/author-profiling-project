I read all the reviews about the place and, did have my doubts. Here's what I found. First off, I am a business traveler. I travel about 1-3 times per month, usually in the U.S. Most times, I stay in a Marriott or similar. The place is not bad at all. The rooms were very clean, spacious, The staff was friendly, and attentive. The casino was fun. It is not huge like a Vegas or Atlantic City, but it was great. The area is a little run down. I felt safe but, like anywhere you have to be on your toes. Keep smart. Don't make yourself a target. Here are a few good things: Great beach / Restaurants were good. Dont waste your time in the Italian place. It was not worth it. / Walgreens nearby was a plus / Starbucks was also a plus / A few bad things:Cabs...They all seem to charge $10 - $15 for everything. I thought, I kind of got ripped off for that.Parking...$15 daily for a guest??? Standard for all hotels in the area.As for the price of $350 per night..What do you want, your in the tropics.Go, have a great time....
