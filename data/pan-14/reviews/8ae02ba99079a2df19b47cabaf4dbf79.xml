It has a great location, a few blocks from the Duomo, so is a little out of the crowds but still close to all the sights, and only a couple of blocks from the Accademia Museum.Our room was large and comfortable, and very clean. I suggest you ask for a room facing off the piazza; ours did and was probably quieter for that reason.The staff was pleasant and professional; they helped us make some restaurant reservations and had good recommendations. Breakfast was standard and good.We booked several hotels for our Italy trip through TripAdvisor's advice and friends' recommendations; this was our favorite.
