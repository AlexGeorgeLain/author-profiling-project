We have stayed in most rooms and have had all our family and friends stay there. It is in the rice fields and has a wonderful view, pool and service. The staff at Tegal Sari are sincere, helpful and friendly. It is a unique Balinese experience--it is truly one of a kind!! I use the airport pick up and the free transport around town. The rooms are spotless, reasonable, and have all the necessary things a 4-5 star hotel would offer. Their spa is highly recommended for quality and price. You feel the warmth of the place--of course I am known by my first name, and even calling from my city in E Java the staff know my voice on the phone. Wonderful value and a heavenly place to stay. I have told too many people about this place--it is hard to get a room--the word is out!! Mr Mike
