I think the resort grounds are picturesque, rooms are clean and modern as is the entire property. We requested a 4th floor room and never took elevators (gotta burn those calories any way we can)Pools are really pretty and the beach is great. Plenty of chairs for all. The shows were typical of AI resorts. The food was good, we ate at ala carte's 3X--Italian once and American twice--could've easily booked more but wanted to eat at buffet a few times and Friday night is Beach Party) Drinks are yummy and fattening. Note to all rum cream lovers in Jamaica....they have Barcelo Cream here..VERY similar to rum cream...delicious! The bars are cool, especially lobby bar (Alisios sp?) Tons of top shelf booze and smiling bartenders that will make you any drink you ask for. We didn't do any excursions but did take a parasail--a must! I dare anyone to experience this and not love it!Another thing I liked about this resort was the staff. Check in...bartenders...housekeeping...wait staff....groundskeepers...ALL were smiling and helpful. I hadn't been to Punta Cana in 4 years and it reminded me of how much I like the people of the DR that's I've come in contact with.I read the negative reviews of EH and once again, have to ask myself...were we at the same place?? I suppose it didn't hurt that we had a solid week of hot, sunny days, never saw one mosquito and don't care about wash cloths (ha ha)If you're heading to EdenH and are concerned, my humble opinion is....DON'T BE. Take your smile, your good attitude and your camera and prepare for vacation bliss. Enjoy!Adios fellow travelers!
