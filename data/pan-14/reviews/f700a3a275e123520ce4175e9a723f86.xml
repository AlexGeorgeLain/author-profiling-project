We stayed on the good side of the building, meaning not direct to Lombard Street - interstate 101. Location is great by the way. One or two times we had trouble parking the car though, late at night. We cooked ourselves breakfast but had coffee and muffins down at the reception. Very nice hard working people. Good souvenir.
