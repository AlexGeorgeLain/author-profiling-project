It could not be simpler. We had a warm welcome, arriving just before 11pm and give a choice of rooms either on the 1st floor or the 6th. We choose the 6th. What a great choice, The room was more than spaciouse. A great bathroom with a jucuzzi, large wardrobes, a safe (2 euros per day for the key obtained at reception) and a mini fridge. The bed was a king size and very comfortable ( ask for room 607 on booking) and what a view from your own personal balcony right over the busy Rablas. The room was very quite even though the location was central. There were electrically operated black out blinds. There was no breakfast included and I felt the cost of it was expensive BUT just a couple of strides away from the hotel you could get english or continentaln breakfast at a very reasonable price. Pianio bar for drinks and coffee is set in the reception area but there are many bars and restaraunts to choose from within easy walking distance. The location of this hotel is fantastic, right in the middle of everything. The tour buses are just minutes away and well worth a trip to see all the main highlights in the city. Well worth a visit and highly recomended. A good 4 star right in the heart of the action. A liitle expensive but you have quality and location in a major city.
