Just returned from a weeks stay in the Affinia Dumont and we were delighted with the location of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. The rooms are large by NYC hotel standards with the kitchen an added bonus. The real beauty of the Affinia is its location, 10 min walk to Macys, Empire State, subway 5 min and a great variety of bars restaurants in the immediate vacinity. We were definately impressed with the Affinia and plan to stay there again on our return to NYC. If there was one thing I was not pleased with its that I had contacted the hotel in advance to request a high room. However we were disappointed to discover that we were in a lower floor were not given the option to change during our stay. The receptionist merely shrugged his shoulders when we asked. I had explained in the email that this trip was a special occasion it would have been nice to see our request had been dealt with.However, this did not affect our stay too much overall we were delighted with the rest of the staff of the hotel who went out of their way to be helpful particularly the door staff.
