Having read reviews of this hotel on this site we were expecting a very nice hotel and were not disappointed.The location, just off the Arc de Triomphe, across the road from the nearest Metro (Charles de Gaule E'toile), was excellent.The rooms warm, welcoming and very nicely appointed.The staff friendly and helpful.The breakfasts catered for everyones tastes, cold, hot, cereals, fruit, cheese, meats, eggs, bacon, sausages, croissants, juice, tea, coffee etc etc.We went to Paris for 3 nights to celebrate the New Year and had a wonderful time. We travelled on Eurostar and the only down side to the whole trip was the huge queues for tickets for the Metro once we arrived at Gar du Nord. Had we known we could have bought them at St Pancras once we had checked in for Eurostar, won't make that mistake again.
