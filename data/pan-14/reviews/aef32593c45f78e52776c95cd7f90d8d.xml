So we decided to book a week in April to check it out, to see if the resort had declined or improved:We have to admit that, overal, the resort has improved in many areas. Our pre-arrival contact with Caren de Vries (one of the Managers who stayed on after Sunscape), resulted in our being afforded a welcome back suite in one of the various new blocks, which are fantastic. If you go to the resort, try and get room 6207. It doesn't have a sea view, but it's a fantastic suite and close to the adult pool.The service, friendliness and attention to detail afforded by all the resort's staff has noticeably improved, and they are really great.Felix (the Resteraunts Supervisor; still there from Sunscape days) continues to do everything he can for you, whichever resteraunt you go to. Rolando (at the Beach Cafe lunchtime; at the Italian evenings), always ensured there was a chilled bottle of wine on the table as you rolled off the beach for lunch.The beach squad were on the beach every morning clearing the overnight seaweed invasion. HOWEVER, since we were last there in 2005, the lagoon itself has become overun by seaweed and is constantly floating loose in the water, making it not very enjoyable to swim in. It's not a problem if you're a Pool person, but my wife I are Beach Bums so I have to admi thatt the seaweed is a downer in our books.The food is the standard you come to expect at any Dominican resort. It has depreciated in quality and variety since Sunscape, but it's still mostly enjoyable whether bufet or a la carte, usually helped down by (in our case) chilled white wine or, on Managers cocktail night, by champagne.In all, it remains a very good, well run resort. It's intimate; not big and overcrowded like some of the other places. It is still far better than Sunscape The Beach, but not quite as good as Sunscape Casa del Mar.By the way, Sunscape are bowing out of Casa del Mar in October 2007, and the Barcelo Group will take over the reort.

My wife I stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand in February 2005 and we cannot fail to recommend it to the highest degree in EVERY aspect of what you should expect from an AI 5-star resort. The beach, the drinks the rooms, the restaurants, the wine, the buffet, the entertainment, more wine, the champagne night, the lobster night, the drinks, the staff (**), the management, the cleanliness, the 6-star beach dinner party (unbelievable), the beach BBQ (unbelievable)....just EVERYTHING.** When you get there, ask for Felix (Restraunt Manager); a gentleman, ace and dedicated friend. Say Princess (the name he gave my wife) sends her love.Unfortunately, The Grand changes name ownership in January 2006.Most of the staff will stay there. But Sunscape will nodoubt take their stars to The Beach (a brand new resort just round the ismus), which is where we'll be in February. JUST CHOOSE SUNSCAPE. See you there !!Alan Sophia Dumelow
