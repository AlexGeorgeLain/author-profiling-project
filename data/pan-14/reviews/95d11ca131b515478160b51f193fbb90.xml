Also conveniently located to walk to all the main places of interest in Florence.I had an enormous, well furnished room with a stunning marble bathroom, all in immaculate condition. Very good public rooms which seemed to be little used. Staff were helpful and breakfast was good. In the evening scented candles were lit in the reception area - a nice touch, typical of the attention to detail shown by the hotel. A minor criticism - the bedroom was a bit dark and could have felt cosier.
