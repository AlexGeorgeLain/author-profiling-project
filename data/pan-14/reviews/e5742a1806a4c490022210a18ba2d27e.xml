Not fancy, but completely adequate. I recommend this hotel highly. Yes, it was very plainly furnished, no clock, and the bathroom mirror is on opposite wall than sink. But, everything else was just what we are looking for. Stayed 3 nights in March. Very safe location. Friendly, helpful staff. Excellent price. Clean, comfortable room. 1 block to Chinatown.I did not miss a mini fridge or micro. I definately will stay here again.
