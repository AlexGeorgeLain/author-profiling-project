And I'm glad I made the right choice! Shangri-la Singapore is an old hotel with charms. I booked for their standard room, Deluxe Tower Wing. Check-in process was professional and efficient. The room is quite adequate in terms of decoration and amenities. It's got ALL that you need but the design lacks cosiness and warmth (that's what I felt). The bahtroom is huge, it has separate shower which is really good. The reason I rated this hotel a four star is becuase the time it takes for Room Service to deliver a bucket of ice cubes is over 20 minutes! And it didn't happen only once, I ordered twice and both took over 20 minutes to deliver! The location is not actually a walking-distance to Orchard Road but the hotel provides free shuttle bus to malls on Orchard Road every hour. Too bad the service runs only till 8pm. In conclusion, I love this hotel. Even though there are newer and more modern hotels like The Fullerton and Ritz Carlton or Conrad, the Shangri-la Singapore lives up to my expectations. I will surely return to the Shangri-la again on my next trip to Singapore.
