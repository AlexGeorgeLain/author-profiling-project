This hotel is a very easy 10 minute drive from the start of the race. We had a suite with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a full kitchen. Everything was very clean, checkin and checkout was smooth, the free breakfast (eaten after the race) was excellent. Unfortunately there were some loud guests or pool crashers around 1:30-2:30 AM that interrupted my sleep. I believe that they were kicked off the premises. I can't blame the hotel for this incident.I'd gladly stay there again.
