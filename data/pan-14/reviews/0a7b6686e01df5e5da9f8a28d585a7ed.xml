We stayed here for the first week of our honeymoon and couldn't have asked for anything more. The staff even gave us a bottle of champagne to help celebrate!We got a corner room with a sofa in and a huge bed. It was very clean and tidy, as was the bathroom - although it seems most American hotels have tiny baths in them!!The Cortez restaurant downstairs is of an exceptional standard and we had some very pleasant meals there - followed by some equally pleasant cocktails.The hotel is situated extremely close to Union Square so is really handy for the shops and for the cable cars on Powell Street that will take you all the way up to Fisherman's Wharf. Having read some reviews for this hotel on Tripadvisor and other sites I was initally worried about it's close proximity to the Tenderloin with it's slightly dodgy reputation, but there was really nothing to worry about once we got there.As part of your stay at the Adagio you'll get 15 minutes of free internet access either wirelessly or on one of the hotel's business centre PCs.If you do stay here make sure you make the effort to go to Dottie's True Blue Cafe around the corner. Awesome!All in all we had a great week at a great hotel and it was everything we could have hoped for.
