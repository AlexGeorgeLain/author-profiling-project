Aircon did not work on arrival but got fixed the next day with a bottle of Cava by way of an apology. We requested a nice room (as we visiting for a birthday treat) a high floor to avoid traffic noise. We were given the top floor (8th) with a private sun terrace which was fabulous to view the city look down on the street below. Staff were helpful and efficient. We would not hesitate to use this hotel again.
