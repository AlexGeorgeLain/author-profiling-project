Stayed one night and toilet backed up at 2AM (without using it). Plumber responded quickly, but couldn't fix it. Had to change rooms at 2AM. Stayed another week at different time and room cleaning was missed one day. Called customer service and was told he would call back after talking to the General Manager. I am still waiting for the phone call.There are two restaurants in the hotel a Chinese and a Japanese. They also have a limited breakfast buffet that is horribly overpriced. No where to get a cup of coffee or a sandwich. It is about a 15 minute walk to the Alamona Center where there is everything including a food court with many, many choices.I would think that a hotel of this size should have more eating choices. Oh, no room service, period.
