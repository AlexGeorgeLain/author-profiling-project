The hotel staff we're very friendly and happy to help with any troubles/queries me and my partner had. Breakfast had a wide range of yummy things to choose from, so couldn't fault breakfast in anyway. Only let down to the hotel was the location, was about a 5 min walk to the metro station, and then about a 10 min trip into central Barcelona. But maybe thats just me being fussy. If your going for a few days like we did, it would be very wise to stay in town because you will have a better chance of seeing everything and less travelling about to do, so more energy to enjoy Barcelona because i have to say its a very beautiful city and so many lovely sights to see. I hope you enjoy your stay In Barcelona as much as we did. Also - a good tip - buy a T10 for your travelling as they are very good value for money and well worth 6 euro's.
