Smallish but well equipped rooms with internet access, clean, good bathroom and a free mini bar. Couple of beers at night, OJ in the morning and water to take out was a nice touchThe breakfast buffet was fantastic with eggs/omelettes done to your liking. A wide selection of fruit, hot food to suit every taste. All of a high standard.The personal butler was a nice touch but over the top for a couple of holiday makers. Staff were great and could not do enough for you. Nice bar lounge and restaurants.It was an upmarket place where we felt at ease.Highly recommended.
