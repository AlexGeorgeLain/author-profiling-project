They were kind, friendly and helpful.My only concern was that the hotel rooms didn't have peep holes. If I was staying alone I would have been concerned.In each room there was free wireless internet and a high speed cable available (if your laptop didn't wasn't wi-fi ready). There was also a computer and printer in the breakfast/wine cheese room on the 2nd floor available for use. No extra charge for any of this.Beds were super comfy.Bathrooms small, not much storage space, but shower water pressure was terrific and shower nozzle was up high so even a tall person doesn't need to bend over to wash their hair.Wine, cheese, champagne, crackers, popcorn, fruit available in the afternoon from 5 - 8! This was awesome and gave us a boost until our evening meal after the theater.We were given bottled water in our room each day, this was included in price!!! So often, you pay extra for this. Rooms have a good sized safe, mini bar and DVD player.Our stay was fabulous and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
