Room was a good size but was let down by small, tired looking, bathroom, though like the room the bathroom was very clean.There was some noise from road as we were on 3rd (2nd in UK) floor, but we expected that and it wasn't too bad.Staff were friendly and always willing to answer our queries. Recommended a good organic supermarket on 2nd Ave, where we brought fruit and yoghurt for breakfast, as we didn't use dining room in hotel.Location was handy for tourist bus, Rockefeller Centre and Grand Central, and just a short walk from a couple of subway stops.Only used Club Room on last day, before leaving for the airport, which was very relaxingHad an absolutely fantastic time in New York and only used the hotel as a resting place, but it met our requirements and don't have any complaints.
