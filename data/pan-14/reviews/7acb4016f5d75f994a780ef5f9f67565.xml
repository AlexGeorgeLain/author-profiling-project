The downtown location is near Casa Mila, Casa Batllo and the Gracia Metro station. We very much appreciated the free WiFi. But there were some issues: 1. The heat/AC seemed to furnish only heat, with no thermostat, and when we threw open the window to relieve the stuffiness, there was a constantly noisy street scene outside. 2. There was a loud dripping noise at times on the ceiling of the bathroom, 3. The bath/shower is designed in such a way that the bath spout protrudes into the center of the tub, making it an easy target for your knee when showering, 4. The room was a bit on the shabby side and in need of some minimal decoration, such as pictures on the walls, 5. Some of the desk staff seemed a bit arrogant and unaccommodating. My wife stayed at the Balmes three years ago and had a better experience. We might stay here again if subsequent reviews on TripAdvisor indicate that the problems have been resolved.
