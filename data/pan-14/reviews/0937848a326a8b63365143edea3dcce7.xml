Very close to Place de CataluniaStayed here for 3 days with the company I work for and would definitely go back next time..Reason why the hotel doesn't get 5 stars is because of the bar personel. The guy behind the bar was not friendly, quite rude even. Prices are quite high as well...Should you go to Barca I would definitely recommend Club Opium in Barceloneta! Great Spot to have dinner and to go clubbing afterwards
