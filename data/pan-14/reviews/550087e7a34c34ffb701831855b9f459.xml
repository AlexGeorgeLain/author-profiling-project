Its always busy even late at night and you will be fine. Firstly about some of the muppets who have reviewed the hotel....... why did you stay in Hollywood ? Its full of historic building and places , if you you love film and old forties film you will love it and this hotel. All you others please go to your theme parks and shut up. This hotel is of a high standard, top draw if you have to put up with the crap serviceand hotels in Engand, Have no worries on stopping here. Go buy a good Hollywood history book from Borders and enjoy the area, The Pig and Whistle is great, Bogart, Bacall, Hemmingway etc all used it in its day........ If you do not like that mixed in with the slightly tacky t shirt stands and all stay away, Santa Monica is lovely.

Have stayed in the sister hotel in San Diego and this is the same high standard. brilliant location right on union square. A large room with all of the usual stuff you expect in the USA. Great standard of hotel for a great price . The only warning is if you want a quiet night the rooms at the front are a little noisy from the traffic on the street, but hey get out and enjoy it and you will be too tierd to care. ! Check out the Gold Rush bar around the corner , a fab little place. Its all in the location baby !
