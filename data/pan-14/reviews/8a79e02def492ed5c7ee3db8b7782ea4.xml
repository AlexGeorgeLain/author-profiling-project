After reading all the glowing reviews and finding a special Expedia rate for $150/night US, including taxes and fees, I didn't bother to look further. What a good choice.The hotel is beautifully modern, rooms are spacious and comfortable, and during a hot summer week, the air conditioning worked flawlessly. We did not go for the upgrade since we were gone all day every day.The staff could not have been more friendly or courteous or helpful. The hotel is around the corner from the main shopping St. in Berlin, and a 5 minute walk to one of the main subway stations in Berlin which is also the drop off point for the X9 express bus from Tegel International Airport - a 20 minute ride for 2.1 euros.When asked for some restaurants within walking distance, the staff sent us @15 minutes walking to a beautiful, tree lined, traffic free, extremely quiet neighborhood with choices for excellent German, Italian, and French - all witin a few short blocks of eachother - and all reasonably priced.I could go on and on. There is simply nothing not to like here!
