Our room was very big and had all the conveniences we needed. It is very easy to find after getting off the vaporetto at the St. Stae stop.Walter and Sandro were friendly and helpful. They make your stay even more enjoyable. The courtyard area is also a nice quiet place to rest after all the hustle and bustle of other areas of Venice.We really enjoyed being in a quieter quarter in venice especially since all of the major sights were easy vaporetto stops from the hotel. We walked easily to the Rialto fish market and the Rialto bridge area. We ate our evening meals in restaurants that were close to the hotel, and were reasonably priced.

I was a little nervous before arrival about staying close to Las Ramblas, but, the hotel location is perfect. It is close enough to the hub of Barcelona, but, it is located on a side street that is quiet at night.The hotel staff members went out of their way to assist us with directions. They were the most professional of the three other hotels we stayed in on this trip.Be aware that taxis are not allowed on the street where the hotel is situated. They have to drop you off at the entrance of the street. The hotel is just a short walk, but, it can be a little disconcerting when the taxi driver tells you to get out.I highly recommend this hotel and Barcelona. The shopping and the architecture in Barcelolna was great. It was also quite a bargain compared to prices in Brussels and Paris which were our next two stops.
