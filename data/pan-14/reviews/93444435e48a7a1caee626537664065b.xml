Facilities are good, food good and lots of it. front desk can be a challenge. get a room near the beach. Long walk/ride from some places like the restaurants in the main hotel area. Buffet restaurants right by the beach. make reservations for the water sports early, also for the restaurants (get the 'rules' upon check-in). will go there again during non-peak when the rates are lower.
