It was superb. We stayed on the 39th floor and had an awesome view of the UN and East River. The staff were very friendly and although the decor was obviously old it was clean. We were originally booked into the Wellington off Broadway but changed due to bad reviews. We are glad we did. If ever we get the opprtunity we will stay there again.
