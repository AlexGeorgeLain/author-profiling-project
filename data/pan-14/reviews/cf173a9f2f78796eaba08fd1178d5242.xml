We had three rooms. All were excellent and very reasonably priced.It was very hot that week in Honolulu. All of our air conditioners worked perfectly. Hotel location in the heart of Waikiki beach was exceptional. We could walk to anything we wanted. We walked two blocks to the Don Ho show and to other things. Swimming pool was perfectly clean and very nice. Hotel's posted photos are very accurate. We highly recommend this hotel.
