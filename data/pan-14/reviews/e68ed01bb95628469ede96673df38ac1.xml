After a two hour ordeal trying to find the place, we arrived and were hardly given a greeting. We were told what buses we needed to take to town and then shown to our room which was right next to the lobby. We had asked for a room with a view of the terrace and were given a room ON the terrace. As a previous review said, the walls are paper thin so if you sneeze the whole hotel hears you. The constant traffic in and out of the hotel is also very audible. Our shower was over the toilet and although I know this is common for older hotels, we were not excited about this and asked to change rooms. We were told that we had asked for a room with a view of the terrace and we have it. Sabrina offered to switch our room the next day to a room in which the shower was separate from the toilet and sink. We also could not open the door to the terrace because the cat would come in our room. The next day we switched rooms and the room was larger with a bathroom that had a separate shower. However, we never felt welcome in the hotel and the whole experience was uncomfortable. Although the room we switched to was not bad the overall experience was uncomfortable and we dreaded going back to the hotel everyday. We had just come from an exceptional hotel in Venice where we were greeted by our name everyday and asked how our day was so it was like night and day with this hotel. Although the room we moved to was not bad, I still have to give this hotel an okay rating because of the service.
