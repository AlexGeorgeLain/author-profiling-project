It is located just six blocks from the Orange Line, which makes it very convenient getting to and from Fenway Park. As usual, I was happy that the front desk agent recognized me and greeted me with a Welcome Back! She allowed me to check-in a couple hours early. I work the overnight shift and wanted to get some sleep before the Red Sox game. I am not a smoker, but had to book a smoking room as it was the only room type available. The front desk agent offered to send up an ionizer if the room had an unpleasant smokey odor. When I entered the room, I was pleased that I could not smell any smoke. I did not need the ionizer. The room attendant really cleaned the room well and made it fresh-smelling. As always, I was very pleased with the hotel and the people who work there. The location is ideal for people attending a baseball game or concert at Fenway Park. I highly recommend this property.
