It was definitely a steal! The hotel is very new and had a boutique hotel feel, with dark woods and minimalist design and furniture. The staff was top notch and spoke English very well. We didn't try the two restaurants inside the hotel but it seemed like they were well-visited (and pricey).Its location just meters away from Shinjuku's South Entrance made it easy to get around (there's also an elevator right behind the hotel's street-level sign that goes down to the subway). Another big plus is that the Airport Limousine Bus stops right in the hotel driveway which made getting to Narita much easier. We had a room on the 6th floor and noise wasn't an issue. The bathroom was larger than expected. There is also a small business center with two computers and free Internet access, as well as a small coffee/tea bar. Overall, a great value!
