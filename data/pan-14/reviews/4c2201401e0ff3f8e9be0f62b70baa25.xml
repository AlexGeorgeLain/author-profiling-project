Suite was great and in excellent condition. Had in-room safe that was very handy. Fair number of children about, but this was not unexpected. Still pretty quiet and could not hear my neighbors through the walls. Free cooked breakfast was nice. I staged a luncheon at the restaurant for 15 folks and was given a private room at no extra charge. Happy hour in the late afternoon was also good.In room internet costs, but there is a free internet kiosk in the lobby. This is a super location for those going to the new Washington Convention Center and there are many very good restaurants within a short walking distance. Put on your walking shoes to get to the Smithsonian museums (or taxi it). Overall a great experience. Worth every penny.
