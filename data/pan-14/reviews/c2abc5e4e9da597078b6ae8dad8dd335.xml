Seriously, I felt as if I am a celebrity or a VIP spending bunch of money for staying at a luxurious boutique hotel. Even before our arrival, we called the hotel to ask about something and the front desk was extremely attentive. Then when we arrived from the bellman to every other staff that we met on the way to the front desk, I felt like I am Madonna or someone super famous: everyone gave us so much attention. The lobby is very antique and feels like I am at some very old mention with grand chandeliers. I asked for the ghosts stories and it was very amusing! My friend and I actually went all around hotel looking for the ghosts. Every corridor has a lot of old paintings, the rooms have very cozy feel to them with nice drapery. The restaurant downstairs has a fireplace, which made me want to go there all the time. There is also a bar next to the dining room featuring an antique cappuccino machine, which looks like an alien. :) They also serve hot chocolate at night and it is SUPER yummy. If it for the hotel, our trip to New Orleans would be a level or two down. Highly recommend it.
