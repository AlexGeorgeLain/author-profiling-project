The staff was friendly and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. The shared showers and toilets were very clean as well. The hotel is also in a very good location that is close to tourist attractions and public transportation. My trips to and from the airport were only 30 minutes long via BART. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.
