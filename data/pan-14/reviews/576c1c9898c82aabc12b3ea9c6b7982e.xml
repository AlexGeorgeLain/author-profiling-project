Our first trip was in 1996 and we have stayed there 7 times. We will return in June for our 50th anniversary and to renew our vows. The transformation in progress is something to behold and we can't wait to see it finished. We have only had good experiences at the Reef-staff, cleanliness,awesome restaurants,convenience to our interests. We have been there during some of the renovation and it never interferred with our enjoyment of the hotel. The staff throughout the hotel is great and we look forward to another great vacation.It really is Paradise!Sharon and Len BardfieldAloha, OR
