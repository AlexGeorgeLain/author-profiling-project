The information provided by the hotel was very poor. You had to ask for everything from shampoo to the TV remote! Since there was no phone in the room, you had to go to reception each time. The map of the property didn't even show our section and in any event just said A = pool, B = restaurant, C= accommodation, etc., which wasn't very useful. If you wanted to know all the bars on the property, the type of entertainment, restaurants, etc., nothing was provided. The staff were very friendly, but only a handful spoke any English. We also heard a couple of horror stories about people having to wait several days to even get a room with a proper bed when they had booked for two weeks and a family not getting their room until 4AM when they had arrived at the hotel around 11PM!The property was also too large for our taste. You either had to wait for their shuttle train or walk 10-12 minutes to the beach. Getting a spot in the shade was always a challenge as people would put out towels at 7AM and then go somewhere else for the day.The beach is as good as everyone says and there are no vendors bugging you. However, it was mostly too hot to walk any distance, so it didn't really matter how long it was! There was nowhere to shop and no town close by worth visiting. There were lots of excursions available, but the average cost was $70+ per person.
