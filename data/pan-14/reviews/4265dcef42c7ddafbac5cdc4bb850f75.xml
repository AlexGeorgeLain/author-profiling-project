This is the hotel for the youngsters who love to take a strike down in kuta beach, do some shopping, have some nightlife, get smashed and your room is just next door.I like the set up of the room, simple and modern with a good lighting. Although I found the room was very dusty. I had to pay for the hotel slippers and laundry bag. They make it like it's a souvenir of Hardrock instead of just a hotel amenities. I found it rather capitalize than accommodating...The service was ok. Location was good for tourists though, near by the mall, the markets, the good local restaurants (oh I haven't start yet about the restaurants in Bali, but don't worry I will!). I wouldn't recommend the beach to my friends though. Too crowded and dirty... JUst stay on their beach-like pool, better than the actual beach...If you still interested to stay there, please make sure that the staff clean it before you're checking in. Especially if you have allergies like me...
