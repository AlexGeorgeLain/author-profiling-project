The staff was very helpful, the room was spotlessly clean, with a silent airconditioner. The room was immaculately cleaned and towels and sheets changed. The tiny bathroom did not bother me at all. It was clean, plenty of hot water and shampoo and soap supplied. The area around the hostal is full of shops, fashion chains and very good nightlife.The hostal is easily accessed by metro, but surely would recommend Aerocity to and from the airport. I would surely recommend this hostal to my friends.
