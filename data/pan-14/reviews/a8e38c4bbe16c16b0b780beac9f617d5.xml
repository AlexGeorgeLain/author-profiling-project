When I walked into my room I noted how small my room was, then I saw my co-workers room which was about half the size of mine. The room was clean, so no problems there. Bed was ok, but not too comfortable. The tv was very small and you got a limited number handful of channels. For internet you had to pay 9.95 a day. The staff was friendly enough but not very helpful. Location was great since it was in Union Square but that was about it.
