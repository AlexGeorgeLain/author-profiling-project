We had original plans to stay at the Warwick. We were meeting my in laws and they had already checked into the Warwick and hated it. They found the Silver Cloud in Capital Hill. The public transportation (bus stop) is right at the corner of the hotel so it was really easy to get to shopping and Pike Place. When we checked in, the hotel did not have a standard room with a king bed so they upgraded us at no charge to the corner suite. It had a jacuzzi tub with a fireplace! Wonderful! The staff was very nice and helpful. They even called to place our dinner reservations. There is a complimentary breakfast every morning in the restaurant- delicious! Highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in the future.

We were probably on the same flight with the people who left the past two reviews. I was a little nervous when Lufthansa booked us at this hotel, but was pleasantly suprised. It was only for one night. The hotel was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable with the bathrooms being spacious. The staff was nice, but the restaurant and pub staff were a little unfriendly.
