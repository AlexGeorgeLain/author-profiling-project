Amazingly comfortable bed. Quiet. Lovely free continental breakfast daily. Convenient to everything in midtown. Valet parking in garage next door. Monkey Bar entry through the lobby is great. Monkey Bar itself has really unusual drinks, all of which were great for us. Hope to return really soon, as there's not much more fun than going to great theaters and restaurants in Manhattan, and not having to concern yourself with the long drive home. Met our daughter and boyfriend for brunch at Bar Americain Sunday morning, and they said they've never seen us so relaxed and happy. If I could afford it, I'd stay there every weekend, but the restaurant bills would bankrupt me, considering I like to go to places like Le Bernardin when I'm in town.
