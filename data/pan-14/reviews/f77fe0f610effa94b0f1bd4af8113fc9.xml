The Argonaut is at Fisherman's Wharf, close to restaurants, cable cars, and the Piers. The hotel was lovely. The free wine from 5-6 was great, and made it easy to socialize with other guests. The room was large, very clean (of course) and well outfitted.

It had the feel of a small hotel with the amenities of a much larger one. Location was superb, as we went to the theatre every night, and we could walk everywhere.
