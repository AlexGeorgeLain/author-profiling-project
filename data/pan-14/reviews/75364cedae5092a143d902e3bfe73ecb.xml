Parking $10.00, breakfast buffett $20.00 ... glad we got the good rate we did with Hotwire !!Management says Westin leases the parking property, therefore they must charge for the parking, so I suggested they comp hotel guests with breakfast, but at $20.00 per person for breakfast that would be a losing proposition.We were on the 10th floor. All elevators were very nice, the hall was newly carpeted, and our room was very nice. Nice linens. No vending machines, which surprised us, as we wanted a soda, and had to go to the gift shop to get it.Starbucks coffee in the room, and if you want more, just dial 0 ... good !USA Today and Wall Street Journal free ... good deal !All in all, a very nice experience.
