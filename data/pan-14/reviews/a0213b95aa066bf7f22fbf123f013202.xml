I was not disappointed by the location, and I also found that it was very clean indeed, as I had previously read on other reviews here. Good location and clean room are the 2 most important things to me, and this hotel did not disappoint me. The room was very small as I had also read on another guidebook, but I planned on staying almost the whole day out of the room, exploring the city, so I didn't care about that. It can be very noisy at any time of the day or the night, both because of the cleaning people and (mainly) because of people who have no respect of the others. Wireless internet was expensive, however the area is full of internet cafe's.Overall a good experience to me, would choose it again.
