Its right in the heart of China Town, and you can easily walk to all attractions!! Just a few minutes of all the best affordable shops in union square and market street!! The room is what it is. The main part was fine, but the bathroom i had issues with. My bathroom ceiling was caving in and everytime the person above me had a shower it would come through. My sink tap would only work now and again! Check out is 12.00pm, and the staff were ringing and constantly trying to get me out of the room from 11.00am!!
