The hotel shuttles did a great job dropping us off and picking us up from the subway station so we didn't need a car. The pool was small, but nice for the kids. Room service was good, but VERY pricey (and the hotel restaurant would not serve any meals to go). I was a little surprised there were no refrigerators in the rooms for a hotel of this quality. Rooms were very nice, and we stayed on the Executive Floor which included a nice complimentary continental breakfast. No complaints, but for a 4 star property they didn't blow us away. Given the price of lodging in Boston, it was a great value for the price. Would recommend.
