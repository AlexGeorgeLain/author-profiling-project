I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona. The hotel was superb and the staff extremely friendly / helpful. On arrival we did request a different room as they had provided a twin room and not a double as we had requested. This was resolved and we got a larger room on the 4th floor with a Queen size bed. You also get an abundance of toiletries which I have never seen in other hotels.. The minibar is very reasonable and the TV has Sky News if you really care what's happening at home.We paid for breakfast and could not complain at the choice and variety on offer. It was a buffet service and you could choose to have a cooked breakfast or selection of cold pastries and fruit. When visiting Barcelona do the bus tour first. It provides a great perspective of the city and highlighted to us many of the places we would like to revisit. You also receive a discount booklet for a lot of the most popular sites in the city as well as the cable car up to the castle. We bought a 2-day subway ticket (which also covers the funicular railway up Montjuic) It was a great way to get around the city when you aren't walking. We ate out in the Gothic quarter which has massive choice of quality restaurants. The Rambla is fine but it's catering primarily for tourists and as such is a lot more expensive as well as being extremely busy. a large beer!! It only happened once. Personally, I am looking forward to returning to Barcelona. As well as being a remarkable city it's extremely beautiful and I will certainly return to Duc De La Victoria.
