Located behind its sister hotel, the Hotel Colon in the Gothic Quarter and only 200 metres from the Cathedral and 250 metres from the Via Laetana. The rooms were clean, spotless, well-decorated and appointed rooms but a little on the small side. The room plans shown on the fire escape diagram seemed to indicate that there were bigger rooms available, but unfortunately for us the hotel was full. Next time we will contact the hotel directly and arrange to be allocated a bigger room.Beds were very comfortable, air conditioning was very effective and shower superb. Towels were changed every day and sheets every other day.Any room limitation was more than compensated by the exceptional location, helpful and friendly staff and the excellent buffet breakfasts. There was even an in-room safe to store your valuables.We would recommend this hotel staying for 3-5 nights in wonderful Barcelona.
