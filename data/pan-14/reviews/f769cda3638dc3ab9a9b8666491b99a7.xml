Stayed here for a week in may with my husband. good points;room (in block 3) was lovely-we had a fruit platter and a bottle of rum as a gift for our anniversary. food was generally good. mexican, seafood, japanese and italian restaurants the best. we took our own beach towels but didnt need them. sports bar great.beautiful beach. nice wreck just off the beach if youre into diving. horseriding ok but expensive ($40).bad points; food in the main restaurant average, paris restaurant crap. some of the cocktails are very weak! bar staff can be a bit surly. night club awful-smells of sick! casino not great.All in all we paid for a weeks all-inclusive, which I think was great value, we both had slightly bad tummies, but I think that ia par for the course when travelling to these destinations. weather in may is not the best-bit stormy.
