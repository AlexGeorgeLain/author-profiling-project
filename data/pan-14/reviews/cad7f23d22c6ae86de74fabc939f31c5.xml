It has a lovely rooftop pool with fantastic views.The rooms are of a nice size - we were upgraded upon checkin - with plenty of amenities including a free minibar which is a nice touch. Breakfast is pleasant but there are too many staff milling around trying to make themselves look busy and the genuine service provided by the hotel is let down a little here. I would definitely stay here again and if you like a little luxury in an amazing location, I would recommend you give it a try.

I have been travelling to Sydney for the last 10 years and have always stayed at the Hyde Park Plaza because of its fantastic location, value for money rates and lovely peaceful rooftop pool. I have always enjoyed my stay here.....until now. The place has been left to fall into practical ruin and the Oaks Group should be ashamed to have it on its books because they offer some very nice properties. The rooms are shabby, the rooftop pool is filthy, there is no longer any pool furniture or chairs. Although they insist they are in the process of upgrading the hotel, they have been saying this for over 2 years without any visible difference. I would consider staying here again if they did make an effort to improve the standards but until then, I'd rather pay extra for a decent hotel in a similar location.
