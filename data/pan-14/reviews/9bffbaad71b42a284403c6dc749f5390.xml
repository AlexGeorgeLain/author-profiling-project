This small hotel is located in a quieter section of the city along a canal. We had room 7 which has a canal view. Saturday night can be a little noisy as there is a Coffee Shop two doors down. The horses also go up and down the cobbled streets to add to the noise but Sunday was quiet. The stairs are a steep spiral so luggage and could be a problem for some. The breakfast is traditional European breakfast of breads, coffee, cheese, coldcuts, etc. and is very, very plentiful. The rooms are well furnished with antiques and comfortable beds. The hosts are very helpful. They stored our luggage early in the morning and provide us with maps and location for sighseeing. I have no problem in recommending this small hotel (and I am a 5*+ traveller).
