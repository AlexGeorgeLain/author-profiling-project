The Restaurants had soiled cushions throughout, the food was very poor in Menu and quality. The breakfast buffet was semi warm, poor in choice and not always clean. We have stayed there regularly since 1985 when it was a genuine 5 star resort and after more than 20 stays it should not rate even 2.5 stars at present. The problem appears to have started when the European managers and chefs were replaced with Indonesion personnel. Staff is aware of problem but indicates that management does not repond to concerns.
