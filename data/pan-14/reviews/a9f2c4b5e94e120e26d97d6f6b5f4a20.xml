The room was clean and a decent size for a hotel located in midtown Manhattan. Another plus was that the room contained a minifridge and other amenities. Negatives: Wireless was $10 per day (which isn't really that bad), but I've received free wireless at other hotels. The elevator was very tight, and made me feel very claustrophobic. I had a problem coming down from my room on the 11th floor, as it stopped on almost nearly all floors below it and picked up a large amount of people to bring down to the main level.
