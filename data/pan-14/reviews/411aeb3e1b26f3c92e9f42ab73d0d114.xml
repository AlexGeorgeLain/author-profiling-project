This hotel was booked for me as a last minute booking due to mis-communications with an original booking at a different hotel. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful even when I had originally booked two nights but only needed one. The room was great with a newly remodeled bathroom. The view wasn't too great, but I was more interested in sleeping than anything else. I had friends staying at the Westin Moana Surfrider and the walk to their hotel was very pleasant, only took about 15 minutes, and I was in the center of Waikiki beach. I would stay there again when passing through Waikiki.

The hotel is right by the station in Florence so it made going on little day trips very easy. The staff was extremely helpful with anything we needed. We were able to check out later with no problems. The breakfast was much more than was expected with eggs, meats, cheese, rolls, brioches, cereal, coffee machines, juice machines, and much more. We were lucky enough to have a quiet room with a balcony that overlooked the city so it was perfect. The walk to the Duomo is about 10 or 15 minutes but there is much to see on the way there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Florence.
