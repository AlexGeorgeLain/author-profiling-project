I do my homework and it usually takes me a full month to search out the very best deal wherever we travel to. It was Labor Day weekend when most if not all hotels raise their rates sky high. I kept coming back to the airport area for lower rates and the Renaissance Montura LAX had the best deal going - about $95 per night! And to make it even better - the hotel honored their guarantee that if you find a cheaper price on any other travel site they will give you a lower price. I found it for less on Expedia and the room rate was lowered to about $68 per night! Now the Renaissance chain is a Marriott hotel so they have a fabulous bed which is wonderful. We got in late Friday night from San Francisco and were received with excellent hospitality, smiling faces and easy check in. We were even upgraded to a higher floor and more expensive room with a 'club' to go to for snacks, breakfast bar if wanted and a quiet place to relax with coffee or a glass of wine in the early evening. The room was clean, had a great view and flat screen t. v. which was great. Good shower and super clean bathroom! I am exceedingly fussy about a clean bathroom in hotels. The restaurant has fabulous food and wonderful breakfast. So, watch this hotel for a great price for high quality. You do have to pay for parking and internet connection daily - so remember to add that extra $27.95 in when you budget your travel plans. It is also is right at the airport with a free shuttle which is so helpful as well.
