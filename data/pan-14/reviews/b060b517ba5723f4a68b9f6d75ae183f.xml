I found this hotel through Trip Advisor because it was my first time to Bali and we wanted to stay somewhere near the airport because our flight came in late. After traveling around Bali, we also decided to come back here on our last day because it has all of the amenities you need and more. It's great because it's within close (walking distance) proximity to Kuta without being right in the center of the madness. The room was very clean and air-conditioned (a MUST). The pool is also great. I highly reccomend going to the spa. It's one of the best and the prices are great. Out of all the spas I visited in Bali, the one at Febri's was the best value. I felt like I was in a 5 star resort when I was at the spa. Febri's is across the street from a larger resort that you can walk right through to go to the beach but there is major construction going on at the beach in Tuban so you don't want to go in the water there. Lastly, the breakfast wasn't stellar and there is major construction going on next door so you may not be able to nap during the day. If you want to feel safe, want air-conditioning and a nice, clean room, I highly suggest booking this place. I would go back.
