True that it's immediate surroundings are not perfect (tattoo parlors, arcades, etc...), but it's well located to be able to walk to almost everywhere. The room was very clean and relatively big by European standards. There was absolutely no noise (perfect for siestas), except for the room maids but it didn't last very long. The A/C was working perfectly too. The beds could be more comfortable but overall we were pretty satisfied with the room.
