Assiduously non-smoking (don't even THINK about it), quiet, in the highly desirable Museumplein, one block from the Van Gogh, Hotel Fita is a true value in an expensive European City.The staff, led by Hans, is fabulous. They are attentive to detail, breakfasts are excellent, and the conversation is delightful Dutch... direct, intelligent, humorous, and respectful. Recommendations for dining close by are top rate.While this was our first visit, it surely will not be our last, for we have found our home in Amsterdam
