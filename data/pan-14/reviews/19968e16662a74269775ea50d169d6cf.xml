So, my only caveat is about location: this hotel is nowhere near the great Ku'Damm shopping area. It's also a decent taxi ride from the main train station, the haubtbahnhof. Location issues aside, this is a wonderful, but VERY Scandinavian, hotel. I love Scandinavia and this type of fairly minimalist design hotel. I have stayed at many Radisson SAS hotels and none are as nice as this. Be warned, though, that this hotel is like very high-end Ikea. If you like older hotels, big heavy furniture and grand ballrooms stay elsewhere. Now all of the great stuff about this hotel: everything, really. Spa and gym are superb. Food is great. Staff is helpful and friendly. Room rates are much cheaper than they really should be. Rooms are clean - very clean. Room has a heated pants press, which is very useful (as I write this, I am wearing impeccably pressed - by me - wool dress pants). The water in the sink and shower is really hot and the water pressure superb. Small but nice plasma TV in the room - very good quality picture. So, from a weary world business traveler, this is a really good - exceptionally good - hotel. Do not hesitate to stay here.
