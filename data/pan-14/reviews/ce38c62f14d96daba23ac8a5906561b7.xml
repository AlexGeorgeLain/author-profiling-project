The hallways are a little dark, but I felt this added to the hotel's calm ambiance. The standard room was a suite (I had a London Suite), with a full couch, flat screen TV, desk, and coffee table in one room, and bed and flat screen TV in the other. It was fairly spacious for a New York hotel room, but the parlor room would be small for a gathering of more than a few people. The room also had free internet, and an iHome iPod docking station, which I thought was a nice touch. The lights in the hotel room could also be dimmed, instead of being turned completely on and off. The bed was very large and comfortable and there was a great double-headed shower. The lobby was a bit small, with no real room to sit or hang out, but no one gave our large group any problems when we gathered in the hotel restaurant/bar. The bar was really great - probably my favorite bar of any hotel I've ever stayed at. Give the bartenders license, and they'll come up with some tasty unique cocktails. The food at the bar was alright, but room service for breakfast was disappointing. It was cold and missing some of the items I had ordered. Apparently the restaurant is much better when Gordon Ramsey is actually there, but he wasn't there when we stayed! The hotel is right in the middle of everything - convenient to anywhere you want to go in NYC. We walked most places - including to restaurants and a broadway show. All in all a sleek and modern boutique hotel, nice if you want a luxury experience and are trying to avoid the major NYC chains.
