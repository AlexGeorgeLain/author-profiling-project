Our room was large and quiet, staff was nice and helpful and WIFI is free. Breakfast was OK, what you can expect from an 3*. The location is very central but you should be advised of some homeless/drunk people hanging around at 1-2 blocks to the south. We never had problems with them, but it could result frightening for older people.
