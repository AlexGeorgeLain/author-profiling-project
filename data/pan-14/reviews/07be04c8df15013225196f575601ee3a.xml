The hotel is beautiful and the staff are the friendliest of people. We organised a day trip to Ubud with the hotel and received a tour guide and vehicle for the day for a very good price. This hotel is so close to a lovely part of the beach and the pool is superb. The breakfast has variety for everybody and the rooms are spacious and very clean. we stayed in a deluxe chalet which was set among beautiful gardens not far from the pool. we honestly couldnt fault this hotel! it is just like paradise!!
