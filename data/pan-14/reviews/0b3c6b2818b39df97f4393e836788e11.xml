Sure it has all the features you would expect of a high end hotel--great attentive service, spacious rooms, beautiful, tasteful furnishings, comfortable beds, etc. However, the Adolphus is unique in the way it preserves and pays tribute to its past. All throughoutthe hotel and the rooms you see wonderfully ornate reminders of yesteryear--chandeliers, lamps, mirrors, bureaus, clocks, lobby furniture, etc. This creates a great atmosphere of sophistication and luxury. If you have any question as to whether the Adolphus is a hotel that is luxurious enough for you, remember that Queen Elizabethand Prince Phillip stayed here during their visit to Texas.
