Good restaurants nearby and we walked almost everywhere. The staff at the hotel were very accommodating -- we were travelling with three other couples and they were very patient giving us directions and suggestions. The rooms were small but clean. The breakfast was fine although costly. We would most certainly stay there again. We booked by email and it worked out just fine.
