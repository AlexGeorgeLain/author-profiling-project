The staff were very helpful, efficient, welcoming and professional. My husband and sixteen year old son and I shared a room with double bed and fold out couch. It was spacious enough to meet our needs, and beds were comfortable. It is perfectly located for quick access to Tegel airport and the free shuttle is a bonus. The property is close to quick bus access and the staff was very helpful in helping us to use both bus as well as hotel shuttle to meet our sightseeing needs. The breakfast was not included in our rate, which is not too surprising given the excellent rate for such a nice hotel. We did enjoy the lavish breakfast buffet once, but it's a bit much in price and quantity unless you are counting on sustenance to last the day. Would definitely return.
