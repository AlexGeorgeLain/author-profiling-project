Everyroom is the same king size bed , huge bath tub( you can watch t.v. while you are in it), and a room for the toliet and shower. We originally had a garden view room, but upon our arrival we gave the check in guy a 20.00 tip (which is 80 pesos) to upgrade our room! We wound up with a first floor ocean view room which looked out at the gazebo. The resort is so beatiful and I would not stay anywhere else while visiting Punta Cana. For one, we went on an excursion (swimming with the sharks) and we met alot of nice people from other resorts and we heard so many horror stories like at one hotel you have to call and get picked up by golf cart if you want to go to the main building which has the resturants because from the room is a 1 mile walk, or that some rooms didn't have A/C!! The ride from the airport for me wasn't that great but it was well worth it! ( I literally got home from the reception, changed and grabbed our luggage and went straight to the airport for my first out of country trip and airplane ride) If I had some sleep and wasn't exhausted I probabally would have actually enjoyed the ride. Food there is great, Just don't drink the water, also, note that no matter where you go outside of the U.S. that food may different bacteria that our stomachs are not used to!! Not that the food is contaminated or anything, just understand that if someone comes to the U.S. from Punta Cana there stomachs may have the same reaction to our food!! Check out their website it is everything that it says it is and more. If you are a gambler the casino is very small, a few card tables, maybe 10 slot machine and a roulette table
