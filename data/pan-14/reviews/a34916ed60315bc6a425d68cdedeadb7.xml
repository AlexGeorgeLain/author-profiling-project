I spoke directly with the manager and found him extremely helpful.We were delighted with the accommodation, especially the fact that the room had tea and coffee making equipment, plus a fridge. Bedlinen was beautiful and the enormous towels were a delight. Everything was of very good quality. Staff were very helpful, calling taxis, recommending restaurants etc. We really couldnt fault it.Breakfast is best taken at the cafe below the hotel, friendly and good service, orange, coffee/tea, croissants, all for 6.95 euros. There is a huge choice of places to eat. We liked the nearby Coude Fou in the Bourg Tibourg, a buzzy little wine bar with good food.We would certainly go back to this relaxing and caring hotel.
