Having stayed at a couple of other downtown hotels, I would say it is probably the best overall choice, if cost is not an issue. Aside from one rude front desk employee (who later called back to apologize, to his credit), the service is classy, the rooms are standard sized, with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms, and the spa/fitness center are very nice. The location is great, if you have a reason to stay in Downtown LA.TIP: When booking your room, request one with views of the much-talked-abou Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by architect Frank Gehry.
