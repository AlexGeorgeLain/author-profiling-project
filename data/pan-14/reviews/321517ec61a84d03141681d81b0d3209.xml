It was extremely easy to get to from the stationand even with luggage was only a 15 minute walk. As for sightseeing everything is on the doorstep.Our room was large, spotlessly clean and considering the situation of the hotel quiet (we'd asked for a quiet room) and we got it! Our bathroom was good and we had the bath, although it did take time to fill, so we just showered. The linen was changed regularly too. Breakfast was more than adequate and to get freshly boiled eggs rather than just hard boiled was lovely, as were the beautiful cakes which appeared each morning.Every member of the team we came into contact with was friendly, smiling, efficient and exceedingly helpful. Nothing was too much trouble from the time we made our initial reservation to the moment we departed. When they realised it was my husbands birthday, he was presented with a bottle of wine, which was a lovely surprise.This holiday was to be special because of this birthday and the the Hotel Casci certainly made our stay very very memorable.
