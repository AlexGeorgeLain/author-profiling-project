My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel in September 2007 and encountered nothing but exceptional service and standards. We arrived slightly earlier than check-in but the man at the desk allowed us to use the luggage store for us to store our bags while we had our first explore of the city. After check-in we paid the 20e deposit for the television remote (which we were quite happy to pay, you DO get it back after all unless you do something stupid with it) and went to check out our room which we found perfectly sized with a good sized bathroom.In the morning of our second day the extremely friendly man on the desk (a different one) filled us in on the best way to see the city and sold us a two day pass for the tourist bus (fun bus) which was possibly our best purchase of the trip with stops all over the city and very frequent services.All in all, I would highly reccommend this hotel for it is cheap, clean and the staff are nothing short of excellent.
