Chose hotel on back of tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed in any way. Location was superb - easy to walk to all the main sights. Cleanliness very high,service excellent. Breakfast (14 euros plus tax) had a very wide choice and good service, with the girl in charge remembering our preferences for coffee after day one! Had requested a non smoking, quiet room and had a standard room on 5th floor facing inner courtyard. Amazingly quiet for a city centre hotel. One point of information - no slippers or bathrobes supplied - but this is not a criticism - just so that other future guests are aware of the fact! Well recommend exploration of the Raval area around the hotel - some very interesting shops and restaurants. Mama Cafe in c/Doctor Dou 10 - fantastic food and wine and atmosphere at amazingly good prices - also ES restaurant one door up from Mama Cafe - more expensive but still great decor and food.
