We booked it as part of a flight package. With 4 different ResortQuest hotels in the area, it's important to know which one you're looking at when you research. I was looking at pics reviews of ResortQuest Waikiki, obviously in error.The location is wonderful, right across from the beach, and a block from the Pacific hotel, 2 blks from the Marriott, and not far from the zoo. The staff is helpful, and It's nice to have the complimentary breakfast (from 7:30-8:30..on the dot!), but that was the best part.Our tiny room faced a blank wall. The carpet was dirty, there was little water pressure on the cold water side, and a bad leak under the sink. The maintenance man said he'd have to shut all the water off to fix it...and said the whole hotel was due to be converted to condos in a month. That explained a lot about the condition of the place. It's destined for improvement, at last.
