Standard additional charges too, for internet, telephone, etc. etc. etc. Our room on the 17th floor was clean, nicely furnished and adequate in all respects, particularly at the price point we got from Priceline Negotiator ($117+tax = just under $142 for a Saturday night). The hotel is very close to Union Square, but if a walker still within striking distance of the waterfront and most other parts of downtown. try the restaurant, but the sunset view from the lounge on the 36th floor is definitely worthwhile.Be sure to plan your budget to include parking if need it. Expect the bums-rush in front of the hotel when you arrive, unless you'll accept valet parking at $49.50/day. be cowed though - You can offload your bags in front and then self-park in the exact same garage kitty corner across Stockton from the hotel for about $26/day!
