This was a nice hotel, The rooms are quite small which is a given but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. The staff personnel were friendly, gave good advise for locations to eat, but given that the hotel is situated right around the corner of rue Cler, (the market street) you had some good restaurants at reasonable prices to choose from..Unfortunately the air conditioning in the room made quite the noise and was not very cold even having it at the coolest temperature, and the elevator was out of order everyday for about 2hrs which always seemed to be down when i would come back to the hotel which was a pain as i was on the 5th floor.The price is a bit on the expensive side for what you get in the hotel but the location was great. *5 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and 5 min to Invalides.Safe Travels
