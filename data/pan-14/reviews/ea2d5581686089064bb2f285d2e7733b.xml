We found that the food and drink was expensive in the hotel but if you walked into Old San Juan about 40 minutes, there was plenty of places to eat and drink. New Years eve party was great, paid a 100 dollars each and you could drink as much as you want in about 12 bars, nearly all with different types of music playing. The hotel is set in a great location right on the beach no problem getting chairs. Would definately stay there again maybe next New Year.
