The location is great - central enough to be convenient, but far enough away from the main highlights to be peaceful. It's off the main road, coming away from the train station to the left. There is another Ibis very near to the train station, but this doesn't have triple rooms.The room itself was compact, but clean, warm and the bathroom (or should I say 'bath'pod') was fab - the shower was powerful and there's good light in there, even though there's no window.There are no drinks / drink machines in the room, so I would recommend you take these - there are vending machines in the lobby, but these are pricey.The breakfast wasn't included in the deal and for the choices on offer, I felt 14Euros was a bit too much - I guess it's the same as most hotel chains though.The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable.I would probably stay here again.
