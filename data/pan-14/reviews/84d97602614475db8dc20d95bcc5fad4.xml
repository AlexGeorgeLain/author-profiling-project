This means that we are near themost important places of Madrid but at night in the room we are far away from the noise and we can rest. From the hotel to Gran Via is 3 minutes walking, 5 minutes to Puerta del Sol, 10 minutes to Plaza Mayor and Prado, 15 mutes to Royal Palace.THE BUILDING: When we watch the hotel for the first time we feel a certain deception because the aspect is too severe and grey, but we are obliged to recognize thar we are in face of a good adaptation of an old building.THE INTERIOR: Some reserve we had desapear when we enter in the lobbyvery beautiful with good furniture, the bar as well is veryconfortable and nice.THE ROOMS: Are very well furnitured but small. However in terms of confort are very well equiped and decorated.In my room the choice f TV channels was very poor. THE SERVICE: The service is really a 5 star hotel service. Very efectivness and staff well trained and simphatic.IN RESUMEN: A good stay
