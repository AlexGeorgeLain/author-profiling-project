Within walking distance of both the Wharf and Downtown, only 5 minutes by car from the Golden Gate Bridge and in an interesting area off Polk Street /Van Ness. Some good restaurants nearby and busy cafes within a couple of minutes.The room was spacious, clean and quiet although the bathroom was smallish. Breakfast, collected from Reception was pretty basic, possibly the only downside. Helpful owners, staff, particularly when we left a camera and for a late arrival (midnight). Whilst we did not use it, good parking on site.

Comfortable rooms and bathroom, if oddly shaped and not very large, which were fine for a short stay. The breakfasts are limited but acceptable and the breakfast room is enlivened by the sight of fellow guests attempting to work out the waffle maker. Pleasant staff and reception, apparantly family run and up to the usual Best Western standards, clean and well appointed.Several restaurants nearby but we suggest avoiding the closest, al Boccalino, a rather pretentious but unexceptional Italian 3 or 4 doors away. Expensive for what you get; we were told very offhandedly that they had no Washington wines. We are an Italian restaurant! At $60 to $100 for bottles one would pay no more than for in a UK off licence- forget it.
