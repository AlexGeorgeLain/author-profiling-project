Booked the Metro on the basis of TA reviews and therefore had a good idea what to expect.As stated many times - its biggest plus is its location and its biggest minus is the size of some of the bedrooms. If moving around space is important to you, don't stay here. We had a king room which looked out into the building well, so it was always gloomy in the room. However, it also meant it was quiet as we could hear no street noise apart from sirens.The breakfasts are great. We found them substantial enough to see us through the day but ideal if your idea of breakfast is a coffee and croissant.Although the room and bathroom are small I had everything I wanted to hand and therefore give it 4 stars.
