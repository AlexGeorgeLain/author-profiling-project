Stayed 4 nights last week at the Excellence Punta Cana and the only complaint I have is that I should have booked it for longer. I think 5 nights would have been perfect. I read many reviews of the resort after booking the trip to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday as well as our anniversary. I wasn't sure what to expect, since some of the reviews I read were quite poor. I can tell you for a fact, that the Excellence Punta Cana could not possibly be better. The resort is absolutely beautiful, the beach is gorgeous and isolated. Everything is well-run, from the restaurants to the bars to the nightly entertainment. Our favorite restaurants were Agave, Barcelona, and of the course the breakfast each morning at Toscana was wonderful. We had the swim-up suite, ocean-view, Excellence Club level and it was totally worth it. We thought we were in paradise. Yes, the bus ride from the airport is very bumpy pothole-filled, but certainly not the brush with death others would have you believe. Once you get to the resort, the long, bumpy ride is well worth it. Do bring one dollar bills for tipping. The staff is extremely friendly, everyone is so happy there. We did not book any excursions, we didn't need too; the pool and the beach were so great we were not bored . We can't wait to go back, only next time we'll book for a longer stay!
