The surrounding area is great, a short walk to the MTR and great location. The rooms are SMALL. I read reviews of the hotel before we booked it since we needed a place to stay when we came back from Thailand and noticed many reviews indicating the small rooms but I thought it couldn't be THAT small and this had the cheapest rate available. I booked a room with two beds. The room was SO small...there was absolutely no room to put both of our luggages. We had to put it in the entryway (which was very small to begin with) to open it up, my friend and I each taking turns. There was no walking room thereafter. We eventually realized there was a funky stench underlying a bleach smell and asked to be moved to be another room. The front desk was really helpful in moving us, but they were only able to move us to one double bed. This room doesn't get bigger. This is a cheap hotel but there's really NO space and it's confining. You may find other hotels at around the same rate and same area as we stayed in another hotel before Thailand.
