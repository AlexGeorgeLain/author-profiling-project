Just north half a block of Bourbon street, so close enough to the action, but not so close you hear the partying into the night. Besides most people head south of Bourbon street so unless people are lost, the north side of Bourbon street is pretty calm. Front desk staff varied from being incredibly helpful, giving us great restaurant recommendations to seeming put out with simple requests.The hallways and rooms could afford to be updated. Fortunately, the bathrooms are brand new. Continental breakfast (so-so) is included while their restaurant in under reconstruction.
