The grounds are outstanding; multiple different natural pools with different birds (flamingos, herons, peacocks, etc.)The food was less than superb but better than average. The buffet was better than the specialty restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and outgoing. There were minor problems but that must be expected in high season. The tours offered were very good. I particularly enjoyed the Outback Tour. Apple arranged golf outings to Punta Blanca and Punta Cana; both were excellent courses; well worth the money.The comments about the limited beach chairs are correct. After getting skunked two days in a row I learned to play the game and got a towel and claimed a chair as soon as I got up before eating breakfast.I recommend Natura Park to all but the most finicky traveler.
