The last time we came, the hotel was completely under construction and we left before even staying there. We returned this year and were pleasantly surprised to find how well the hotel turned out. They completely redid everything. There was even new furniture out by the pool (which my kids enjoyed since it was much to cold to swim where we are from). The new expanded fitness center with all new equipment was a plus for my husband, and I was happy just to have a quite breakfast in my room. Food was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating. We didn't have to worry about a thing the whole time we were there. You must give this hotel a chance...you will be thoroughly satisfied.
