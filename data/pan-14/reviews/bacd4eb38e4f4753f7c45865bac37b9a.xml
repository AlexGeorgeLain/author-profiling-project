We also rented a car at the hotel for one day and drove down US1 to Monterery , what a beautiful drive . Get the 3 day pass to ride cable cars , street cars and buses for $ 15.00 each . The Bart system dropped us off close to the hotel for $4.95 each from the airport.Excellent securty and staff. We picked this Hotel from reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, We will return , Thank you .
