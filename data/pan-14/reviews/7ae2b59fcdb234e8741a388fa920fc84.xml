The hotel is conveniently located to Rockefeller Center, the theatre district and Times Square. We were able to walk everywhere. It's a beautiful hotel with above average rooms. Our room had recessed lighting, book shelves, a Bose radio, marble bathroom, towels replaced throughout the day and a comfortable bed. The only negative to the room was the noise from being on the street-side of hotel. I recommend that you request a room away from the street. The breakfast was okay, nothing great, but sufficient. My husband wanted a Coke with ice and had to pay an additional $5. I would definitely stay here again. The location, cleanliness and well-appointed rooms are worth a return visit. I would also recommend that you book well in advance in order to get the lowest rate. We paid $240 per night, but spoke to some others who paid a great deal more for the same type of room.
