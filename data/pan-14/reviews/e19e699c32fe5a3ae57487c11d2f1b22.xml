The rooms are clean, comfortable and a good size, with all of the conveniences that you need. Breakfast is an excellent buffet of fresh juices, fruit, meats and cheese and great coffee.The only downside is the noise level. The windows need to be soundproofed. Since we stayed during the run up to New Year's Eve, the late night noise level was louder every night and at times woke us up. Since we live in city, we are used to some noise. That is the only problem.
