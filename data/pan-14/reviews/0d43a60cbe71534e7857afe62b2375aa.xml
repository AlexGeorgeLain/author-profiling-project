However, we weren't disappointed. The hotel exterior is being renovated at present, so first impressions weren't great, but a fast, efficient, courteous check-in (rooms ready late morning) soon gave us confidence.Rooms on the fifth floor were clean, bright and comfortable. There's a new wi-fi flat screen with TV, radio, computer etc, but we didn't have time to play with toys.The music in the bar late night was mellow, drinks expensive, as ever, but we only had one.Breakfast was very pleasant, service good and a good choice of cooked breakfasts, cooked to order, not a buffet. There were comlimentary newspapers too. A nice touch.The only slightly negative point is that the hotel is a good half mile from any Underground station; useful to know if walking is a problem.
