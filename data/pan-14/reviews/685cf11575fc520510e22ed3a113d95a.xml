There is a connecting walkway that makes travel simple for convention center attendees. Check-in was a breeze, and while I have read previous comments concerning rude service, I experienced none of that during my eight days at the hotel. I can't say the staff were overly courteous, however, they always smiled and answered my questions to my satisfaction. My room was perfectly adequate and clean, with marble bathroom, and 42 flat panel TV. The king size heavenly bed was spectacular, and while I normally have trouble sleeping in hotel beds, this one put me to sleep within 10 minutes.... I agree with previous readers regarding on-site food selection; It is limited and very expensive. You have to travel across the bridge to get to the good restaurants in the downtown area, however, people seem to forget that this hotel caters mainly to convention center attendees. There are two very good restaurants within a three-quarter mile easy walking distance called The Barking Crab, and Anthony's Pier 9. The Barking Crab has picnic tables, down to earth great seafood choices, in a very casual (jeans) atmosphere, while Anthony's Pier 9 is more upscale with extremely good food. Anything else, requires a short cab ride costing $8-$10. The hotel bar, while not having the most ambience was adequate for late night cocktails. Overall, a fine hotel for convention center attendees, and adequate for others trying to save a few dollars from the pricier downtown hotels.
