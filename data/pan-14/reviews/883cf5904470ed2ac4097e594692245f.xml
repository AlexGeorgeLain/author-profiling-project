Around the hotel you find that inmigrants from different parts of the world (Colombia, Egipt, etc) gather in different outside cafes. The elevators were small (european standard) the breakfast (included in price) was better than expected. The rooms were acceptable and clean. Reception personnel were helpful always. Internet conection worked properly. No problem getting a cab in 5 minutes (reception personnel got it without problems).
