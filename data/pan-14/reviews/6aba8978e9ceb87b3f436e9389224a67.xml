I like a clean, cheap hotel that is near all the sites in a city. i believe you get what you pay for!! In the hollywood holiday inn this is certainly true. The hotel has a great location for exploring hollywood. It is on a busy road less than 5 minutes walk to hollywood boulevard. we felt very safe at all times of the day walking to and from it. Our room was very clean and spacious and a nice size. We never ate in the hotel but the menu seemed good. The pool is average sized and the gym is tiny but we were too busy sightseeing to use these. We didnt have a car and managed just fine with the buses and metro that are located on hollywood boulevard. The hotel also run a free shuttle to universal studios which is very handy. We found all the staff to be very helpful.Overall we enjoyed our stay here, it was perfect for what we wanted, a cheap cheerful clean place to lay our heads!!
