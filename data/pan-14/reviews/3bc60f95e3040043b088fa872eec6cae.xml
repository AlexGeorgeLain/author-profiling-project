Overall the rooms, we saw quite a few, are in need of refurbishment, the pictures in the brochure and online are nothing like where you stay, they are grubby. The Entertainment was very repetative, all by some nights embrassing the audience with going on stage doing pathetic games, it was just dancing the same dance to different music everynight. The food, was never hot, never had enough plates, and not enough variety. We were glad to be going home on the 31st Dec as on the 2nd Jan the hotel was 10% overbooked, which was going to be a huge problem. A lot of the guests were already unhappy and were changing hotels. After going to peurto plato in april 06, we have been very put off going back to DR. On a positive note, the pool and beach so close to one another is very nice even though the location is a little remote. In a nutshell, our advice is DONT GO!! Find somewhere else, there are alot of other nice places to go in DP.!!
