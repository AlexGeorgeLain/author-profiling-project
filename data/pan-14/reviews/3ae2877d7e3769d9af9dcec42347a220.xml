Was not too impressed to find we were staying in a Travelodge but was pleasantly surprised. Excellent location - only short walk to harbour and transport. Good room/bathroom - recently refurbished.

Courtesy bus arrived about 10 minutes later. Room was excellent with the most comfortable bed and plenty of toiletries. Breakfast buffet next morning was good value.We decided to go to collect our car (off airport) before checking out. We asked if the courtesy bus went anywhere near the car hire depots and they made a special journey to drop us off.
