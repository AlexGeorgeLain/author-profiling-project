BUT, after the first night me and my roommate had huge bumps all around our body, probably due to Bed Bugs or Spiders. We told that at the front desk they were surprised (I'm sure they lied when they said us it was the first time) and moved us to another room. We also had new bumps after we moved in the new room, less but that proves that the other room also had bugs or something like that.The hotel is really old and no so well maintained. It's not worth the price we paid per night AT ALL.Do not stay there except if you have no choice... or if you like be covered by big bumps.
