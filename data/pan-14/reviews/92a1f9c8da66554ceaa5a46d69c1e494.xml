I highly recommend this place.If I could change anything my wish list would include 2 things. First, free internet. This place does cater to business traveler and business events...so internet should be free. Second, we were in the ajoining building...and in the morning I was awoken to the doors slamming in the corridor. Doors are big and heavy and they really slam when they are closed. I was on vacation, so doing a bit of sleeping in...but that was harder at this hotel.
