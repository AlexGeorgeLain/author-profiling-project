Only complaint would be on first night, champagne was meant to be there on arrival and I had to go down to reception and ask them to send it up- however the staff were very nice about it and sent it up straight away. Also had a similar problem on second day, when I contacted reception to get chapagne for the second day sent up the receptionist was confused and told me I had already had the free champagne- the day before. However, the manager on duty was very helpful, checked the booking and sent up the champagne for us.Other than those two small things, the stay was wonderful. The restaurant staff were excellent, the food was delicious and the room was great. Very comfortable bed, good sized room, however there was no plug for the bathtub? disappointing as I was looking forward to a nice relaxing soak.All in all, a very good value package, I would definately stay there again, and will recommend to friends.
