It wouldn't survive in HK otherwise.Criticisms include hotel's location which is quite isolated and if you want to see HK Island you have to taxi into town and elsewhere. Also I found the style of the hotel a bit antiseptic. I was staying in the SPG club floor but still found the rooms small and lacking any charm. The use of mirrors everywhere creates the illusion of space but thats sort of cheating really. My room, despite being informed it was sea view, actually faced onto a hill and overlooked a busy road. No free internet service either. Nothing major just not my cup of tea.That said the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.I would only stay here again if the room rate was well discounted as all the traveling about was wearing particularly in HK's heat and humidity.
