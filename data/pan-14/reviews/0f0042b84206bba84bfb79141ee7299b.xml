We stayied there for our honeymoon and totally loved it!The staff did everything they could to accomodate us. We stayied there for a total of 11 nights. They were the only hotel to offer breakfast FOR FREE! The rooms where beautiful, comfortable and CLEAN a little small but perfect! Every room had a balcony, and even if you booked the 'partial oceanview' it seemed like you got the 'ocean front'The pool is a little small but the beach is a 20 second walk.I would def. go back any day!!
