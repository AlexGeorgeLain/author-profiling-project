Just like to say that staff were friendly and attentive, the breakfasts and bar snacks were excellent and the rooms, although simple were of a very high quality. All in all a great stay and exceptional value for money compared to other London hotels. If I ever need to stay in London again would not hesitate to re-book the City Inn.One tip, book direct through the company website as this saved me on a 2 night stay compared to some of the leading online hotel reservation sites.
