The staff was friendly, the rooms were well-furnished with very comfortable beds and the restaurant made a tasty burger. Additionally, the hotel is centrally located - easy walking or taxi distance to anywhere you want to go in the city and there are plenty of hotspots nearby to stumble home from. Wireless internet was included with the room the staff made sure we had a steady supply of clean wine glasses. An easy standout!
