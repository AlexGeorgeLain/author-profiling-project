Everything else about the hotel was great though.Location was fab, with a tube stop right outside the hotel, and within walking distance to the waterfront and shopping areas.Room was fairly large with a super-comfy bed. Bathroom was great too - loved the fact that the radio was tuned in so you could have a relaxing bath! Room was also spotlessly cleaned every day.Overall a great stay for our 5 day trip.
