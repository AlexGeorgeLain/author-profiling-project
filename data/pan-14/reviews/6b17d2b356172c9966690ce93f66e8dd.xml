We were walking distance to shopping and restaurants and beaches.A nightly hula show on the beach was directly across the street at 7:30. The show was free and excellent. We could stroll down the street and select a place to have cocktails on the beach. The beach access was easy to get to and lounges could be rented, and we watched a surfing competition during our stay.The two pools at the resort were never crowded, and the one closest to the beach had food service and drinks out in the open. A good variety on the menu made the meals even dinner worthy if looking for a lighter fare, or appetizers if looking for an afternoon snack.Great stay!!!!
