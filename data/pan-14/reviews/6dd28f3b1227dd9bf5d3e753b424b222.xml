We could not have been happier.Upon arrival the staff was courteous and helpful. In our room was a beautiful flower arrangement, wine, posters of welcome and congratulations on our 40th, a beautiful picture frame, and hearts on our bed.We had a oceanview room on the 6th floor that had a beatutiful view. The pools and beach were wonderful.We enjoyed the daily breakfast that was prepared as we asked and the manager's reception in the evening was great.While we were staying the Puerto Rico National Honor Society was having a convention. To find 200 or so very respectable young people who dressed very nicely and were very quite was reassuring to us of our younger generation.Keep up the great work Embassy Suites. We will look to stay in your facilities in future travels.bbdubois@msn.com

The food was very good with the exception of the steak house which was awful. Go to the International Restaurant for a very good meal. All the food with the exception of the steak house was very good and plentiful. We don't drink that much, but when we did the drinks were very good. The beach is great to walk on, enjoyed the water and just relaxed. You can walk for miles. Pool was great, but we liked the beach as it was quieter, away from noise. GREAT FAMILY VACATIN PLACE.We were in building 3 and had a great maid named Maria Martinez. The room was always clean and if we needed anything we just asked Maria.Do the Bavaro Runners for a great day. If you go ask for MiMi as your guide. He and John were great.
