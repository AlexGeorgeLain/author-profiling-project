It was conveniently located, the staff was incredibly helpful, and the rooms were great. The hotel even has dark shutters to keep out the light for those late Spanish nights! The only slight drawback is the lack of room service on-site. Overall this hotel is perfect for visiting Madrid in style.

The hotel staff was very friendly (we dont speak any Spanish) and were so helpful. We definitely recommend this hotel for the location and the quality of the hotel. Great experience here!
