We had no trouble checking in. The hotel charges a parking fee aware just in case you rent a car. I had read reviews about folks being served rum punch upon check in. There did not appear to be any punch being served, so I asked about it. The front desk clerk was very polite. She indicated since the lobby very busy, punch was not being served. Instead, she said she would have wine and cheese sent to our room. Naturally, I was delighted. After several hours and two phone calls to the front desk, we never received the wine and cheese. I thought it was a sure thing too, especially since we use Marriott ALL THE TIME for our hotels. Too bad; I was really looking forward to it. Overall, the hotel is very nice and the pool area was clean. There is a lot of shade, but not a problem for my husband and I, as we burn easily. The casino was fun. The blackjack was at $5 minimums during our visit. The craps pit opened in the evenings, but the minimum was $10; too high for us as we both like to play. If you want a pre-made pina colada, not hard to get in the casino. I asked for a rum and coke and it took forever. My husband received three pre-made pina coladas in the time it took me to receive one rum and coke (and we were both tipping). Service was too slow. Although we had a nice time, I think I would stay at this hotel again.
