The bathrooms were small though had some inconveniences which I have reported to the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel on several days found it good. Plenty of places to eat to suit all tastes, in all price ranges, in the area. The real strength of this hotel is the staff who were unfailingly cheerful, helpful, polite welcoming. Any problems we had were dealt with without delay ie our TV did not work because someone (not us) had removed the batteries from the remote. We had no problem with the lifts. As other people have mentioned, don't miss the Top of the Rock

We had a very comfortable, quiet room with large bathroom. The hotel was warm comfortable with exceptionally charming, helpful efficient staff. The breakfast was delicious the complementary coffee, chocolate or tea very much appreciated. The hotel is on a lovely stretch of a quiet canal within easy walking distance of almost everything. There is a selection of restaurants to suit every taste pocket just around the corner in Spuistraat . The only negative thing I would say about the hotel is that the grouting tiling in our bathroom needed some maintainanceThe only negative experience we had in Amsterdam was that we were very overcharged for our taxi from the station. We asked the hotel to get us a taxi back to the station. This was less than half the price we paid to get there
