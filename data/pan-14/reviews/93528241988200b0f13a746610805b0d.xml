This is a big and busy hotel, so if you are looking for warm and personal service it's not for you. However, the rooms are very spacious and in good order, and the view of Singapore was terrific. I could see Raffles and the Singapore Cricket Club from my room. I stayed on the executive level - 58th floor, and had access to their lounge -- free breakfast and evening drinks and snacks. If you can get a good rate, this service is definitely worth it. Breakfast was quite good, staff pleasant, though busy.The bathrooms might be less than adequate for two people (only one sink), but they are very clean and nicely done and the shower was good. The only real criticism I have is that the bed was a little too hard for my taste. If you like plush pillow-top mattresses, look elsewhere.I found the desk staff very pleasant, but there are often long lines at reception and crowds at the concierge desk. Many airline personnel stay here, but they have their own check-in desk. I ate in their top floor restaurant one night -- very good meal, super service, fabulous view. The presence of the shopping mall next door was quite handy -- the crepe cafe in the food court is especially good. I recommend the grocery store on the lower level for good prices on Singapore gifts to take home.

This is NOT one of NYC's most elegant hotels, but the rooms are spacious, the stafffriendly and helpful, the location is terrific, and the price is more reasonable than most. We just returned from a 3-night stay in a two bedroom suite. This is the second time in the last year that we have rented a 2-bedroom suite at the Eastgate Tower. The living room is huge, each bedroom has its own bathroom, and there is a basic but adequate kitchen, complete with dishes, silverware, dishwasher, stove, microwave, toaster, and full-sized refrigerator. They have wi-fi access in the rooms for $9.95 a day -- it worked well.I was in NYC on business, and shared the two bedroom suite with a work colleague, as it was cheaper than two rooms and you get more space. We shopped for breakfast foods in a great grocery store a block away, and ate a couple of lunches in a terrific American diner on the corner.The furniture is a bit shabby, and the beds could be more comfortable though are tolerable. But everything has been very clean, and the hotel staff very friendly and service-oriented. This hotel won't work for you if you require elegance and a touch of luxury, but if you want some space, clean bathrooms, and a kitchen in a safe neighborhood a short walk from Grand Central, it is a good and economical choice.
