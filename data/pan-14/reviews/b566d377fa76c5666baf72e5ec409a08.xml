Being so close to Bourbon street, the rock music invades the room, if you are unlucky to have a room on that side. They need to install double pane windows. Another problem with being so close is that when the drunks come back to their rooms at all hours of the night, they make a LOT of noise. Walls are thin. During the week, this shouldn't be a problem, but weekends are another story. Breakfasts at the adjacent restaurant were really pricy, so we passed and went for beignets.
