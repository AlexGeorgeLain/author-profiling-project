I got a great deal on a room that was very spacious and well appointed, but very dirty. The couches and carpets had stains, etc. On balance, I could've put up with it if it weren't so darn far from downtown. I was there for work and the drive to downtown LA from Westwood was a nightmare in the morning. Beware if this is for business travel.The bar was very busy on Saturday night. The scene was more obnoxious than hip, but it was a scene nonetheless. If I had business actually nearby this hotel, I would consider staying here again, despite the shabby room. The staff was very pleasant, and the food at the restaurant was quite good.
