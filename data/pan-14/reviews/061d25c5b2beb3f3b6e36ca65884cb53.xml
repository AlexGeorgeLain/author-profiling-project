Situated on Dam Square opposite the Palace, it was a prime location. Bus and tram stops are right across the street, so it was easy to get anywhere. The hotel itself was inviting from the lobby onward. We arrived early in the day, yet a room was ready for us. It was clean and well appointed. The business center was handy, and the front desk staff was pleasant and eager to serve. We would stay again if the occasion arose.
