We truly enjoyed our stay at the Milano. As many of you have commented, it is situated in the middle of Old San Juan in the perfect location for visiting the forts, restaurants, and nightlife. We had a very pleasant room on the fourth floor facing the street with little or no street noise during our visit. Housekeeping kept the room immaculate. The restaurant on the roof terrace served delicious meals in the evening. What impressed us the most were the attentiveness and kindness of the owner/manager Juan San Emeterio and his staff. He was the perfect host beginning with his prompt email responses regarding our reservation to his seeing us off when we checked out. We encourage you to consider the Hotel Milano on your next visit to San Juan and to take the time become acquainted with Juan. He is a very interesting and erudite gentleman. You will come to find him to be a writer/poet/artist and an interesting individual. When we next visit San Juan, we will definitely stay at the Hotel Milano and look forward to seeing Juan again.
