My overwhelming memory of this hotel are the bathrooms which are really so naff they should be granted some sort of historical preservation order. Pink marble, gaudy fittings - incredible. The problem is you keep spotting the same pink marble elsewhere in the hotel and this leaves you deeply traumatised. The good news is the hotel is about to have a 36m dollar makeover - hopefully the bathrooms are top priority. Pink marble aside it's a nice place if a bit dated. The big, open lobby is intimate enough to enjoy pre dinner drinks. Breakfast service is friendly and efficient as is the valet parking. The central location, just by Union Sq. makeS this an ideal place to stay to enjoy Downtown and restaurants but just be careful not to wander into Tenderloin which is very nearby - we did and felt threatened and vulnerable ( we were jostled and called white trash).
