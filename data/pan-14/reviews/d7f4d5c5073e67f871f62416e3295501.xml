This old lady needs a facelift but overall it was not a bad place. She is ugly compared to the great architecture SF has to offer. Good location for the Civic Center/ Opera/Symphony. Only about 4 blocks to the California Cable Car terminus. Hotel food was basic hotel food...but being SF, dining out is part of the whole SF experience. Single women travelers may want to use caution as it is on the edge of the Tenderloin area, but Van Ness is a busy avenue. I was there during the week and it was quiet, but I did notice that on Friday more people coming for weekend getaways. It is nothing fancy but not the black hole of Calcutta either.
