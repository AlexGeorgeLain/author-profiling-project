Hard to locate -- my cabbie tried to drop me at the main Courtyard by Marriott downtown. Evidently, this hotel was recently rebranded as a Courtyard.The rooms were normal large-city sized rooms -- in other words, they were a bit small. But for one person or a couple, they are fine. The shower was excellent - large with a good spray. All the room amenities were fairly new and functional. The bed was veyr comfortable and the room very quiet.The only complaints were that the room was quite cold. The thermostat seemed stuck on full air conditioning. This is NOT a full service hotel. No bar or restaurant, but there is much nearby. Cabs are not easy to catch; it's on a side street, but the bellman ran a block away to get me one.Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful. Nice place to stay.
