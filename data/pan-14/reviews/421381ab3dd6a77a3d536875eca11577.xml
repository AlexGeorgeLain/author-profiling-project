Furnishings in good condition and bed very comfortable. Bathroom clean, and good quality complimentary toiletries.Breakfast, a good choice of continental and cooked breakfast plus additional choices made to order. The staff are what makes this hotel special, so often large hotel chains spend on the appearance and facilities only to let themselves down on staffing. The staff at the Hilton London Canary Wharf are a credit to hotels management - friendly, efficient and always on hand to help.I strongly recommend this hotel whether your stay is for business or pleasure.
