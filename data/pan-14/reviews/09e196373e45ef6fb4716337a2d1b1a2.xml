I had emailed the hotel in front to ask for a room on one of the higest floors and they did their best to take this request into account. We had a room on the 9th floor and could enjoy from a lovely view on Barcelona.The Hotel is located in a quiet area and the tube is nearby. On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by staff at reception with a glass of champagne. Check in was nice quick.Breakfast was included in our room price and what a breakfast. So much choice, including cavaWe used the Wellness centre once- really relaxing!Would definately book this hotel again.
