The rooms are small, very functional with cutting edge decor, which we enjoyed. The down side was that they tended to be a bit noisey. Staff were helpful and the rooms very clean the beds were also very comfortable. We would stay here again for the location, and as we were tourists and did not want the facilites of a 5 star hotel (i.e. gyms and resturants) we were happy with the cost saving. The ability to be able to walk anywhere was such a bonus, we would be happy to stay here again. The high speed internet really worked in our room.
