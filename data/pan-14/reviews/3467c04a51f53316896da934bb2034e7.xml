Was upgraded to a premium room on arrival. Mini bar free and re stocked daily, beds luxuriously comfortable and great shower. Staff are friendly and efficient. Breakfast is a good buffet choice daily, room service choice isn't particularly good. Overall enjoyed the stay and would recommend the hotel.
