Did check the bed for bed bugs and not a sign! We were in room 404 which was to the front of the property but used to living in a busy city so noise was not a problem. Room and bathroom large and good shower pressure. Could do with an update but my main concern is that a room is clean, which it was. Staff at the front desk were very helpful. We wanted to buy a digital camera and they pointed us in the right direction (Bestbuys) and we got a great bargain compared to UK prices. Didn't eat in the hotel at all but did have a drink in the bar (also very friendly staff). Had breakfast in Bob's, just down from the church which was used to film Sister Act. Great when you are awake at 0530! The next morning we had breakfast in Mel's Drive In which was like something out of Grease and excellent. Only 15 mins walk from Hollywood HIghland which has a few restaurants. Would recommend the Pig and Whistle pub which do great food as well - also not far from the hotel. Tip for UK travellers - didn't realise you need to show ID in most shops if using a visa card. Even for a meal they sometimes asked. Ended up having to carry the passports about with us, just in case. Dot Iain, Edinburgh, Scotland
