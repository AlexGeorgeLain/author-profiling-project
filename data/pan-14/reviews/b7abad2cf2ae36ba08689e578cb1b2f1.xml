I took my two boys and my mom...we had an amazing time at the resort.when we arrived we were greated with cool towels and a fruity beverage. when we got there they gave us the wrong hotel key our room so we had a small incident. The hotel mamager was very accomadating and said that he would move us to a suite within the next few days. Our rooms were clean and very nice. A little musty but your in a hot country...what do u expected!!!The a la carte restaurants are phenominal!! especially the japanesse teppanyaki restuarant..we ate there twice..the buffet was also suprisingly good...I mean your in a different country so what do you expected, not everything will be north americanized!!!the beaches are beautiful...very breath taking. everyone keeps complaining about the prices of things in the shops like snacks ie chips and chocolate, but can't forget that the bags of lays/doritos or kitkat are all IMPORTED from the states, so they need to make money...and it's not just at this resort, I have been to the domincan 3x this year and it's that way everywhere you go!! The resort is beautiful, the people are very friendly, and always cleaning!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED....I FELT VERY SAFE ON THE RESORT WITH MY KIDS, NO COMPLAINTS!!!LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED ITI WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR.All those complainers out there should stop travelling to different countries!!
