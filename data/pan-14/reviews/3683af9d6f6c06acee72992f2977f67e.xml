We arrived earlier then the regular check in time but the receptionists were very friendly and found us a room in just a few minutes , Nothing was to much trouble for them . Our room had a king size bed which was probably the comfiest hotel bed I have ever slept in !!! There was some noise but I guess in NY this is inevitable and it certainly didnt keep us awake at night.The room and bathroom was spotless. The location was fantastic and literally 2 minutes from Times Square . A few other reviews have comented on the size of the rooms being small but trust me you are so close to so many great sites , bars restaurants you are not going to be spending much time in your room anyway , Our room had ample storage and space and was dinitely as big as the the average UK hotel room .
