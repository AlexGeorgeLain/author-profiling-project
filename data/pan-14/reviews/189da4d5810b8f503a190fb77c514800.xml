The Pan Pacific Singapore is an immaculate hotel tower with impressive views and a great location that is quite close to major points of interest. I traveled with my sister, who tends to be picky about things like cleanliness and strength of air conditioning and even she was thoroughly impressed!!! The Pan Pacific is convenient by taxi to any location in Singapore and just a short walk away from the Merlion and the Quays which offer scenic views and a great chance to experience the beauty of Singapore. The showers/baths are immaculate and made us not want to leave the place! The only drawback is the expensive cell phone rentals and internet.
