Rachel and Pepjin are wonderful - so helpful, kind and laid back. Not only did they give us great recommendations for places to go hear music or eat, but they were even kind enough to let us borrow a spare cell phone!The hotel itself is exactly what we were looking for - fantastic location; spacious (by European standards), clean rooms and bathrooms; great breakfast; and reasonably priced. We stayed in the Retro room and loved having the quite garden view.We were so pleased with our stay and would not even think of staying elsewhere for our next visit. Laura Ford
