The restaurant staff and chambermaid were absulutely beautifull people ,always greeting with a happy Hola! Everyone wears name tags and if you take the effort to call them by their name they respond with smiles ,even when they are rushing about.We found the buffet food good enough with a different theme each nite,the dessert bar untouchable and the supply of delicous tropical fruit unending. Try it, you might like it!
