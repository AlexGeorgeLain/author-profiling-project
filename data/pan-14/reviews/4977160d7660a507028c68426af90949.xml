About 25 canal homes all connected together in three rows. We had a room on the third floor, inter court yard. I did not like this location as the lights were on all night long in the hall way that were across from our room. If we ever go back to Amsterdam, we will stay there but a different location. I would request the garden or canal rooms.This hotel is central located to everything. Anne Frank home, Dam Square, museums, and near great places to eat. The hotel is prices for the food are expensive, but very very good.The rooms are amazing. Wooden beams on the ceiling, wood floors. The bathroom has heated floors! Amazing bathroom too.Loved this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anymore.The only thing I wished they had was coffee makers in the room.
