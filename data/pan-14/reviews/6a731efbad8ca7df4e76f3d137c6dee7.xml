Paid in a club room, which also included breakfast and free drink each day of stay. Only problem was reception told me on check in that breakfast wasn't included. I checked the site later and found that it was, on calling reception they apologised and we received a free dinner that evening too. The only other slight gripe is a tray charge for room service.Apart from that, good friendly staff, nice clean and modern hotel. Good location for easy walk to river and Westminster area.
