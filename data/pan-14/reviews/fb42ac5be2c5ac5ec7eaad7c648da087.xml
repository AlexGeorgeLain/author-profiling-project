No frills but great location being a 30 second walk from Grand Central Station.Room was small but not a real issue for us only staying 2 nights. Room had great view into Amsterdam town though.Hot breakfast didnt have has browns or bacon so a bit disappointing for full english breakfast lovers!Canal Bus hop on hop off tour stop right in front of central station.
