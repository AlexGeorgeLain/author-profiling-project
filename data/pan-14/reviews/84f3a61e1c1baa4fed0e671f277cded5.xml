This part showed, from the bed you sleep. Every time you would turn, you would feel a new spring hitting you in the wrong and uncomfortable spot. The looked as though they just bought the property from another hotel that went bankrupt, the lobby looked presentable about the rest whole was more a 2 or 3 star with furntionings and fixtures.The next morning I went down for breakfast, this was unbelievible. You have two options when ordering breakfast la carte in the restaurant which over priced to the buffet. I chose the buffet, hot breakfast was about $25 and continental was $17, but overpriced for what you get. In the hot breakfast you get 4 half dishes for hot food, which was cold or had no more. Since eggs werent on the hot food item, which was then asked and staff gave attitude after ordering the item. If I was travelling for business or pleasure, I would not recommend this to anyone. One of the worst experiences I have had in hotel in Australia.
