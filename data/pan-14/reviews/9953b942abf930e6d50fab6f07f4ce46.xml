I had checked rates for several nearby hotels. Grand Hyatt may be a few dollars more, but for us it was well worth it. We arrived in the International terminal, walked into the hotel, checked in, had some appetizers in the M Lounge and slept well that night. All in all it was very convenient and the hotel is very nice.
