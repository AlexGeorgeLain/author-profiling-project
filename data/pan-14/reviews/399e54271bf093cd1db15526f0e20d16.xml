The room was cozy and it was easy to access. My only problem is that they toast the buns to their burgers, and it's a little crunchy on the outer edge, which I don't like. Otherwise, it was a nice night for me.

The staff was nice, there was a decent restaurant, and the room was great. The bed was incredibily comfy, and the shower was THE best shower I've ever been in. My only problem was I had to get up early to make my flight home. Otherwise, I liked my overnight stay here.
