However not to confirm the compliments would be to demean the efforts of the owners who obviously work very hard to give their customers a pleasant stay and to show that London isn't all about ripping the customers off.

The reception has the charm of a police station.We accept that German hotels do not provide tea making facilities( WHY ?) but the drinks vending machine was out of order for 4 days, just when a hot drink was needed in sub-zero weather.No hair drier was provided in our room even though the website says they are in every room.The carpets in our room were badly stained by the bedside (?) and the paintwork had seen better days.The duvets which prutruded from the barely adequate covers had also seen better days and did not bear closer examination.Upon leaving the lift on the fifth floor (our friends who were on the same booking were on the first floor !) we were met by vacuum cleaners, empty bottles and dirty linen which was there for 2 days. Overall housekeeping was poor.THE STAFF DID NOT PRESENT A VERY PROFESSIONAL IMAGE WHICH DID NOT ENCOURAGE CONTACT AS WE DID NOT FEEL THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECTIFY ANY PROBLEMS.On the positive side is location and breakfast which was very generous.
