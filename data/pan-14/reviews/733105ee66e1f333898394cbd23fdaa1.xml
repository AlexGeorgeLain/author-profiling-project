The Hotel staff were friendly and eager to please and the concierge AKA Ralph - was beyond excellent! He arranged reservations to the best spots, got us tables at all the right places and took care of getting us through the doors to all the clubs.The rooms were modern, clean and the beds comfortable. The highlight of the place is the rooftop pool area is run by another management group, but you would never know the way they liaison with hotel staff. Joe took care of every last detail and never missed a beat. Great Stay and I cannot wait to get back. My only complaint - avoid the restaurant attached to the hotel - even though it's a high end name and full of the 'right' people - service and food is awful. Find the Meat Market on Lincoln for the best food and service.
