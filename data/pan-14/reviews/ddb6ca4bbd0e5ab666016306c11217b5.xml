Upon checkin there is a beautiful lobby, and vallet service is efficient and friendly (only a few more dollars per night!) I would recommend doing the whole vallet thing because the parking garage is a bit of a pain. We probably used the vallet service 3 or more times per day of course coming in and out to see all the different area attractions. The rooms are just average (used to be a Holiday Inn) although the beds are luxury! First good night sleep I'd had in awhile! No fan in the bathroom, no mini-fridge or wetbar, no balcony, although there are beautiful views of the Beverly Hills downtown area. I wouldn't recommend walking to Rodeo drive. You'll need a car in L.A. There's NO complimentary breakfast (you have to be a priority member.) The business center came to a convenience although there is a a charge to use it. The pool was too cold in October I don't think it's heated but we got drinks from the bar and enjoyed the whirlpool jacuzzi! This is a good place to stay for the cost I think we paid $100 per night. I would recommend it more for business than pleasure.
