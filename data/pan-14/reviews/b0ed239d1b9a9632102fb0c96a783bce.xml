He turned out to be the nicest one out of all the hotels we stayed in that holiday. There are limited parking spaces, but we had one of them. The room had typical boring decoration, but it did have everything we wanted - fridge, microwave, iron, coffee maker, hairdryer, large bathroom and ok comfy bed, and food in reception for breakfast. Its close to some great bars and restaurants, and over the road is a very useful supermarket. It was easy to get to other places in San Francisco, and easy to walk to Fishermans Wharf and Chinatown - but don't try walking up and down the hill in between, go around it! I would definitely go back again.
