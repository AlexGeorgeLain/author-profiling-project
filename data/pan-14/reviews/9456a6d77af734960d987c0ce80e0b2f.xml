We had lovely triple rooms on bottom floor near breakfast room (family of six) with the cleanest bathroom I have ever had in a hotel. Well organized rooms with lots of hooks, closet space, shelves, etc. Excellent, delicious full breakfast every morning. Six- or seven-minute walk to Pimlico station, slightly longer to Victoria. Definitely lived up to its reviews, and I read hundreds before I booked. Child-friendly (we have four). It was the only hotel that met all my criteria before booking, and it met every single one of my requirements upon arrival with no disappointments. Stay at the Luna Simone!
