We didn't get the room/bed that we reserved, and the staff was unhelpful. Best Westerns used to always have nice hotels, but this one doesn't fit that mold. We'll choose a different hotel, probably more expensive, the next time we visit Seattle.

I understand why some people might not like the hotel... it's just a small hotel with very limited services in a sports bar area near the Bankworth Garden. However, we found it very satisfactory: the room was large and clean, at an excellent price for downtown Boston (we paid $117.80 a night average for a queen bed). Virtually all hotels in downtown Boston are well over $200. And we like bars! Plus easy walking distance to the North End, downtown, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Beacon Hill, Boston Common, and the T is a block away (Boston's great subway, you can go everywhere).We recommend eating in the North End: try Regina Pizza, Pagliuca's for traditional Italian, or L'Osteria for fancy. Try the Corner Cafe on Prince Street. It's more of a bar, but it is classic italian!We'll make the Shawmut our place to stay in Boston
