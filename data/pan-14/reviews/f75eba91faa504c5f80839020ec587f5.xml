My husband and I stayed at the Banks Mansion over August Bank Holiday. We upgraded to canal view room which was well worth it. As soon as we arrived we were impressed by the building, the cleanliness of the hotel, how smart and how helpful the staff are. A special thanks to Nina who made us feel so welcome, and always had a smile for everyone. All staff lovely but Nina stood out from the rest. Our room was large by european standards, spotless and as mentioned by others had very well stocked mini bar. The breakfast room was lovely with a good selection of foods, my husband enjoyed his freshly made omelettes very much. Once again everything was spotless. Amsterdam is a lovely place to visit with very friendly helpful people. So easy to get around and we always felt safe. If you are making your way from the station to the hotel by tram make a note to get tram number 24, 25 and I think 16 also goes there. the hotel is a couple of minutes walk from the tram stop. Ask for Herengracht Canal. Thank you Banks Mansion for making our stay a wonderful one. Lorraine and David.
