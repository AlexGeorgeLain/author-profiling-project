Taxis from the airport charge what they like. the hotel minibus is friendly cheap and efficient. Very friendly, helpful staff everywhere in hotel, the buffet breakfast voluminous and unchanging, repetitive for a whole week. Rooms spacious, quiet and clean, and comfortable beds. All you could hear on the 7th floor were the police and ambulance sirens, day and night! Like the bathroom, bidet, constant hot water. We walked into the city easily enough, though the excellent Madrid metro was only two minutes away. Thoroughly recommend the tapas and restaurant across the street. We liked it.
