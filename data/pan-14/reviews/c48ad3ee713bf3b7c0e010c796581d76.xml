Stayed twice in the last fortnight, and both times had excellent, comfortable rooms (great beds with huge pillows and clean, spacious en suites). Ideally located for a short walk to the main tourist areas, or the Metro, or the bus; adjacent to the Eixample area and the gay attractions, too. No need to pay premium for an allegedly 'gay boutique' hotel just up the road - this one is perfect! The reception and catering staff were friendly at all times and keen to please.For example: we were initially put, for the second stay, in a room which had a leaking tap. We rang Reception, who rang Housekeeping. Housekeeping quickly arrived to fix the tap BUT we were whisked off and upgraded instantly to another room - didn't have to ask or hint at all! This is during summer, too, so occupancy was fairly high. A sure sign that guests are their priority, I would say.
