Note, however, that the hotel is NOT within walking distance to Fenway Park unless you're up for a two-mile walk; cabs are plentiful, or the subway is very convenient to both the hotel and the ballpark. There are other hotels much more convenient to Fenway, but the price is insane, $300 a night and up. Book on the Holiday Inn website for good prices, detailed description of the options, and Priority Club points. When I checked in, I got a surprise upgrade to the executive floor as a Priority Club member! Very nice room. Spacious and very clean.This hotel was safe, clean, and quiet; as noted, most guests this date were families in town for a Red Sox game. (Looks like it's mostly a business hotel during the week; Mass Gen Hospital is right next door.) Jimmy at the front desk is great. The hotel is in a city neighborhood, but not a bad neighborhood. Plenty of amenities within a block; Starbucks of course, CVS (drugstore), Whole Foods Market, White Hen Pantry (like a 7-11) I went to Pizzetta Pizzeria right across the street that had great pizza and calzones for a post-game snack. It was full of locals, always a good sign. The sign said it was open until 3 a.m. on weekends! Hotel does have an outdoor pool, which I didn't check out but looked good through the window.Great location convenient to most of what Boston has to offer, clean and well-run, and cheaper than the comparable chains. Only warning: stay away from the hotel restaurant. Breakfast from the buffet was so cold that it was inedible.
