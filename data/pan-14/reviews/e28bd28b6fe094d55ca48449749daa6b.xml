I would have liked to give this resort an excellent review, but honestly can't because of the poor wait service in the dining rooms. Even though the hotel says it has 10 restaurants, several of them (Chez Isabella, Agave) are extremely small and very understaffed and the staff that is there has obviously not been trained. We met one guest who was fuming after waiting 1 1/2 hours to be seated and then another 2 hours to get his food! Other problems included a constant shortage of pool towels, rooms that were not made up until 5:00 pm, several power outages (one lasting over 10 hours). If you try to communicate with the staff at reception, or practically any other place the standard answer is wait ten minutes!On the plus side, when you do get your food, it is almost consistently very good, the beach is superb, the grounds are very well maintained, the security staff is alert,the rooms are spacious and the spa is great and easy to book!
