Recommend buying the 10 journey tube ticket for convenience. Very nice small neat hotel with very friendly staff. It serves continental breakfast which is an adequate start to the day and the bar is very cosy after a long day.We booked directly with the hotel which was the same price as other web sites but they included the continental breakfast in their price. Some rooms only have a shower so if baths are your thing book a room with a bath in advance. Recommend the Blue and Red bus tours which leave fom Catalonya Square every 15 minutes and if you buy the two day pass you will more than save the additional costs by using the discount vouchers given. All the main attractions and food outlets take them. Avoid Las Ramblas restaurants as they are only there to serivce the tourists. There are plenty of nice ,better value restaurants on the side streets.
