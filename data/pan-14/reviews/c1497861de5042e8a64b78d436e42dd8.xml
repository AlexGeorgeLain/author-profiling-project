The villa was kept beautifully clean, the staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. Our butler Wayan made sure all our needs were met, he was great. We ate in all the time and enjoyed the Balinese food prepared for us.Having our laundry done was a real bonus. The driver was very good and also helpful.The spa treatments were wonderful, I could do with some now!We are both past our sell by dates and have travelled extensively over the years and mostly stayed in 5* hotels. This holiday and villa lived up to everything we wanted it to be.We are going back to Bali and Balivillas in November with two friends as we were so pleased.
