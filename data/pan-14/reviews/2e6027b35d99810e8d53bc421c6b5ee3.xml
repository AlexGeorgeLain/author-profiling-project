The overall experience wasn't awful but it definitely wasn't what we were looking for. Granted the hotel was at capacity over the holiday weekend, but despite the signs all over the pool area stating that lounge chairs could not be reserved, if you didn't get to the pool by 8AM there was nothing left but shady spots (which is more than half the pool area.) The children's pool is fantastic, but larger than the adult pool which wasn't all that inviting, what with a tattered volley ball net strung across the width of the pool.Service was friendly and efficient; better than we had expected. But I found it really annoying that at 4PM daily, small signs were placed on every table in the lobby announcing a two drink minimum per person. Every evening the lobby became a bustling discotheque. The noise was deafening. There really wasn't anywhere to go and have a drink at night other than the lobby disco, an obvious cash cow for the hotel which attracts many more locals than hotel guests. The disco seemed to go until about 4 in the morning.Food was average. Nothing to write home about, but not terribly expensive. We mainly ate breakfast there and the service was very good. Poolside lunch was subpar; mainly airport quality sandwiches and burgers.The beach was littered with cigarette butts and fast food debris and not all that inviting.Rooms were a bit tired and generally bland. Beggars can't be choosers over a holiday weekend so we made the best of it until we could move over to the Ritz Carlton. If you're looking to party all night, this might be the place for you. But for a relaxing weekend get away it's not so hot.
