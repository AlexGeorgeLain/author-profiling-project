The entertainment team are fab Best are 50 cent Usher and Stephanie.The only bad comments I could make for our vacation is the 4th July meal on the beach. The whole hotel had to eat on the beach as they shut down all other restaurants. But there was not enough lighting or adequate seating. The evening entertainments is good the coral for kids and adults is great way to spend an hour after lunch when the sun is at its strongest.Bar staff are friendly look to be tipped all the time I only tipped good service. believe in tipping for the sake of tipping.The beach is excellent we went snorkelling most days on the reef the fish and coral are all here also went sailing all part of the all inclusiveGo to dreams and have a wonderful time
