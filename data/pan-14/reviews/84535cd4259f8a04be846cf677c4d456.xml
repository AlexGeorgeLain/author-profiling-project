I did explore and found the long hall and stairs to the other floors as mentioned by others. Our room was small but otherwise fine as was the small bath.Breakfast was meager even for Italy but better than nothing.We booked because of the location near the train station, though in the rain it wasn't close enough! We also took a bus to Siena from the station right close and yes, walking to the main sights and market was very easy. One of the best things was a little restaurant a couple of doors away called La Grotta di Leo where meals were reasonably priced and apparently popular with the locals. We ate there 3 times along with family and school groups in the various rooms which were always full.
