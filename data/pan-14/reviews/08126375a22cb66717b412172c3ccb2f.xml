The location is super. Surrounded by wonderful restaurants, Grill 23 and Atlantic Fish to mention two. Our room on the 11th floor was a two double beds room. The room was more spacious than most other hotels where we paid a far higher rate. Beds were comfortable. One ding -- no choice of pillows, all very large. Bathroom while not huge was certainly adequate and well planned. Lots of very nice towels and a great shower.The staff was top notch. Check in took minutes. The concierge service was excellent. The City Bar was beautiful and very popular with a nice crowd of people.I highly recommend The Lenox to anyone wanting to be treated like somebody while they are in Boston. We would happily stay there again.

No cost was spared in the decorum of this fine hotel. The staff makes you feel like you are someone special as soon as you check in. It is far enough from the bedlam of the center of Florence that you are not bothered by any noise plus its close enough to the center that you can walk there in no time. Ultra modern facilities in a beautiful setting. We would definitely stay here again.
