The hotel is beautiful, especially the pool. My son loved the different pools and there is a nice pool area for kids with slides. The service was pretty good, but expected a little more for a 5 star hotel. They ran out of towels for the pool one day. But the people are all very friendly and love kids. There is a kids play center and an inexpensive babysitting service (about $5/hr). The spa is awesome although pricey, same with the restaurants. We enjoyed the Ritz and would recommend to others. Also recommend hiring a driver for a day. We used a guy named Putu who was excellent. Costs from 300.000 Rupiah to 450.000 Rupiah per day per car. He has an air conditioned SUV and provides a great tour. He is very proud and knowledgable of Bali culture. Highly recommend Putu's tour :
