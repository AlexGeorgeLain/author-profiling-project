The room we stayed in was no more than a box room though supposed to be a double, taller than it was long.It was very dark even during the day due to it opening into a very small inner courtyard. The Bathroom was clean and no problem. We found the hotel quiet, almost too quiet as the bar area was only open during lunchtime. The lounge was always empty as there was no reason to sit in there though you could get a drink ( tea, coffee, cans of drink including beer from a vending machine) Not condusive for creating a friendly atmosphere as everyone just retreated to their rooms.If you simply want a base to sightsee then the Hotel is ideal. Breakfast ok but always the same, plenty of it.
