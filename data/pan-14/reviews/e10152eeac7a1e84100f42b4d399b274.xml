We had a double room with great view a bathroom that was out of this world. It was fantastically well designed had absolutely everything you could want for a couple of days of luxury - right down to rubber ducks for the bath.It is quite expensive, but somethings are worth the expense I think the Conrad is worth it.If you can get a deal, don't hesitate to book. I doubt that you will be disappointed.

I also quite like a view of the harbour when in HK.However, the rooms cleanliness can't be faulted the staff are excellent. I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone.
