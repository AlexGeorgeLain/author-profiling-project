The hotel is nice, clean, in an excellent location in the center of town close to everything. We used the nearby Metro station to get around....the Metro is safe, fast, convenient, and easy for visitors to figure out.Our room was in the back which overlooks a school that had basketball and soccer games going until about 8:00pm but actually this was not a distraction and probably quieter than the front which is on a busy street. The only complant we had was with the bed which was poor (you roll to the center) but otherwise everything else fine. Breakfast was included and the quality was excellent. I think this hotel can be a little pricey for what it is, I might stay here again but would also look around at other sites before coming back.

A jewel is a hotel others may pass by that turns out to be excellent in many different ways.....I especially try to avoid the large, unimaginative, and expensive chains and stay in the local hotels that have so much to offer. Yes, I know that this hotel is part of the Carlson group but when you're there it doesn't feel like it. The prior reviews posted here are what I relied on when making our reservation, and I wasn't disappointed. So please read these reviews and you too won't go wrong. Location, price, staff, facilities, cleanliness, it's all here, I wouldn't stay any where else. By the way when you're there try the Bon Ton Cafe next door, it's excellent.
