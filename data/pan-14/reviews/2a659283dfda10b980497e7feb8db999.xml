Just came back from Bahia on June 9th and all I can say is....this resort is huge....Do not get me wrong we (wife and 3.5yr. son) knew when we booked, but the size really surprised us. No problem thou as there are trams every 1-2 minutes.On with the review:Flight -- we flew with Sunwing and except a 1.5 hr delay, due to one of the flight attendance sickness everything was just great.Check in -- done on the bus on the way to the resort, once in about 1 hr wait for the room....no problemo....Food -- Buffet....pretty good, always something to choose...A la carte:French -- I liked it, wife and our son did not....Japanese -- very good...Italian -- very good....Grounds -- absolutely georgeous, amazing...i could go on and on....Room -- Very clean, big....hmm a room... :)Beach -- worth travelling for....no words to describe it, must be seen....Stuff -- very friendly....no English? No problemo....remember you are in Dominican....you make the effort, we did and it was very much appreciated.Overall -- Very nice resort, great holiday, only complaint.....too short....Enjoy!!
