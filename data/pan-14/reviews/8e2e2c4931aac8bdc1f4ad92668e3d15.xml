The location is fabulous, the service excellent, and only the breakfast spread became somewhat tiresome... All subways stop nearby and you can get anywhere in the city from Pza Catalunya. Our room was modern and a nice size with all conveniences (great bathroom). rooftop pool was lovely, but contained some very unpleasant chemicals (anyway, you should just go the beach!). This is a new and swanky, boutique hotel and I believe it has restaurant plans. I think I would rather stay in a new hotel in the city and not be concerned about air conditioning or street noise that go with some of the older facilities. Barcelona is eminently walkable avoid the Ramblas after walking there once a map to navigate the old parts of the city.
