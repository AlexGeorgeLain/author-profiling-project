Hotel has recently been gutted and rebuilt and our room was very hi-tech and stylish but fairly compact. We did not like the bathroom which was cramped and had walls of semi-opaque glass!We found breakfast in the hotel expensive and would suggest you pop across the road to one of the cafes in the elegant Queen Victoria Building. This was our first time in Sydney and we loved it. We had a great views from our room but would not stay here again.

Everything you could possibly want in the room including large flat-screen TV. Enormous variety on offer at breakfast and very attentive staff. Quietly located in a cul-de-sac but a stone's throw from the convention centre.If you do not wish to eat in the hotel, there is a good selection of bars and restaurants opposite in the same street. A 2 minute walk brings you to the Singapore Convention Centre from where you can walk in air-conditioned comfort to the theatre, shopping malls and Raffles City MRT station.After a busy day out, we headed for the lovely rooftop pool which, unlike most hotel pools is a really good size. We were greeted with a complimentary glass of iced water and sliced apple and were invariably the only people there.
