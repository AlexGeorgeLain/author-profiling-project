The double decker bus has a stop at the stop light. The cathedral is still under renovation. The morning breakfast is excellent. The best breakfast we had during our 3 week trip to Europe! Not much more to say that hasn't already been shared. If you are traveling by train from the airport, get off on Plaza Catalunya. Its about a 10 min walk. Just ask for the cathedral and you'll find your way.
