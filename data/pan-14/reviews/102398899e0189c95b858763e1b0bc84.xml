Excellent location for cruiser's, you can walk right to pier 67. Lobby and rooms are more forest lodge decor while loungeand restaurant are very modern and interesting. Views from thelounge are great as you are right over the water. For those thatsuffer from mal de mar it could be a problem, but then it's agood precurser for your cruise.Rooms are small with fireplaces and some have city view whichare fine but not very scenic. Bathrooms are tiny but fully equipped and stylish.Nice amenities in bathrooms. Very clean, neat rooms. Service was friendly if not always accurate with information.It's a long uphill walk to restaurants and shopping. Seattle hasgood transportation system though.Be sure to visit the flight museum outside the city.
