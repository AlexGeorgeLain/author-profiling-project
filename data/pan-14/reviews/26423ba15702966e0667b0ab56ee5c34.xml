After 3 weeks of excellent hotels and service on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland we were dropped back down to earth when checking in. First of all, we booked 2 rooms as there were 4 of us, when checking in they had us down for 1 room, 2 double beds (1 being a settee). We argued and argued with different people until they agreed to put us in two separate rooms (no apology or anything). Then one of the 2 no smoking rooms we were given smelt of smoke. Not just smoke but fresh smoke. The carpets in both rooms were also stained and needed a good clean and the shower in 1 room was not working properly. It seems that with this hotel if you a business prerson they accomodate you, if you are on holiday you are just an inconvenience. To top it off, we wanted a taxi and when we asked it was as if it was a hassle to ring. The location is not too good either, right in the middle of chinatown. $8 for 1 hour of internet access is extortionate and everything that is in your room you have to pay for.I would never go back to this hotel.
