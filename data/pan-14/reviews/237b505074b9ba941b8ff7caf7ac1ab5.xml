I feel I may have made the wrong decision as the price difference was only about per night.It's in a good location approx 10 minutes walk from Victoria station. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the two men that run the place were very helpful and pleasant.The rooms are very very basic and the breakfast is also very basic. The satellite TV is 7 maybe 8 channels and if you have trouble getting up stairs this place is most definitely not for you.I wouldnt warn people to steer clear of the place but for a small amount of extra money you would probably get something much nicer.
