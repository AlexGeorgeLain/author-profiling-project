And I have to say I was not dissapointed.The Hotel has a great location (in Hong Hum area), 5 mins from Kowloon Bay which is like a centre for most of the activities in HP HK has one of the best views of HK frm the lobby itself. Wait till you check in to your rooms. I was living there with my family for 2 days and all of us had a good time.The restaurants are quite expensive and if with family u can always eat out. Nevertheless, there are plenty of shops outsid ein the market and convenience stores so eating out is never a problem.The conceirge was particularly very helpful in telling us directions and modes of travel etc.The Door people happened to be of my nationality hence finding special cuisine restaurants and places to shop was very convenient.All in all, we had a great time and would love to stay at HP next time we are in HK.
