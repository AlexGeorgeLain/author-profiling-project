The rooms were small and the bathroom tiny but who needs a huge room when you're really just sleeping here at night and sightseeing by day! It was always immaculate and clean and we even had cookies to welcome us, in the room.The hotel has an excellent view of HK from the rooftop pool. Its right next to a metro station and tram stops. There are also local shops where you can get food and drinks next door.The hotel is 5 minutes from the shops in Causeway Bay but we really liked being in Kowloon and wished we'd stayed there. The hotel seemed to be a bit far away from the main attractions but with the metro nearby it was only ever 20 minutes at the most.We'd recommend this hotel if on a budget but if you can afford it, there are nicer hotels in HK.
