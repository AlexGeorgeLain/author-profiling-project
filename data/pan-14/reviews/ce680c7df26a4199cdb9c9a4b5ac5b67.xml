Friendly and welcoming staff and a fantastic breakfast to set you up for the rest of your day.It's location is ideal for visiting most central locations on foot, though trams run past the hotel at frequent intervals.For example - 10 mins walk to Ann Franke Museum and the Jordaan region, 5 minutes to Dam Square and the Palace and Neuw Kerk museums (and Plaza Mayor shopping Mall). 10 minutes to the flower market, 20 minutes to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum.The only negative I would say is the late night noise of the trams going by. Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this gem to anyone
