This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in, perfectly located, very helpful polite staff and lovely modern spacious clean bedroom and bathroom - fresh flowers and lots of toiletries provided daily. Lovely little bakery opposite hotel served breakfast very resonable. Excellent location in gothic quarter to walk everywhere and feel very safe. Easy walk from Aerobus, tour bus shops and la rambla to hotel. We wouldnt want to stay anywhere else, looking forward to returning. Stayed on 3rd floor overlooking front of hotel with small balcony, no noise problem at night at all and beds very comfortable. Heard several people in reception of different ages happily returning again and again.
