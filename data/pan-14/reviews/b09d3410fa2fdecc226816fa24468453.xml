The hotel is centrally located in the center of Singapore with MRT subway and Starbucks on the door step, walkable distance to Suntec City, and 5 mins by MRT to Orchard Road (East). Spacious room with modern amenities and business like (cold but efficient) services. A bit pricey but still good value for money.
