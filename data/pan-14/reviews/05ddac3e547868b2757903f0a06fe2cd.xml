The Ponte Vecchio Bridge is about half mile along the river bank from the hotel.Impressive lobby area with lots of marble and period furniture. Concierge desk very helpful on anything you want to see and gives good supply of maps for free. Reception staff are also very helpful.Bedrooms have high ceilings and match the of the hotel lobby. Beds are very comfortable and have super soft pillows. Bathrooms are all marble with frosted glass door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Air conditioning is efficient in cooling the room (We went May 2005). Notice on window warning of opening of windows because of mosquitoes and midges. My wife was bitten.The Donatello bar has a full range of drinks and draught beers. Drinks are expensive but you get a full range of nuts and crisps plus small pizza squares in the evening. IL Cesptello restaurant is expensive but the food is very good. Wine list expensive but you can get wine of the region at 26 Euro per bottle and also wine by the glass.Lots of small restaurants nearby and serving sandwiches and pizza. Prices here are cheaper and you can sit outside on the pavement tables but watch the mozzies.
