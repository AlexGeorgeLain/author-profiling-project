From the first time we stepped out of our car to the last time we climbed in to leave to go home, our stay at the Tower Beverly Hills was a delight. The entire staff was friendly, helpful and made our stay even more enjoyable. Kudo's to Reggie at the front desk, he was just the nicest and most welcoming person and started our trip to Los Angeles off perfect. If we had any questions or needed anything he took care of it right away. The valet's never put us in our car without first asking if we needed directions. The room was decorated in a very warm and elegant design, the bed was devine and the entire room and bathroom just felt clean and smelled good. We had a fantastic view of Beverly Hills and the location was perfect. We will definitely come back to the Tower and next time bring our dog, they are pet friendly! Thank you Tower Beverly Hills for making our trip a wonderful experience!

From the first experience with the front desk to the last good-bye as we drove out of the secured parking lot, this was just the most pleasant experience. The French lemonade that was served as we checked in was a delightful way to begin our stay, and it only got better after that. Any problems were addressed immediately and with a smile. Directions were very good and a map was printed off when needed. It is not the fanciest or the largest, but it is just a wonderful, fun and clean place to stay while in Hollywood. In fact, you would never know you were only two blocks from one of the busiest streets in LA, it was so quiet and peaceful. We will definitely be returning to the Magic Castle!
