It was comfortable, beautiful and in a quiet neighborhood, which was refreshing after the crowds of Barcelona. We took the Bus Touristic, which was about a 10 minute walk away but the subway is about a block away and easy to use. The only thing that we were disappointed in were the lack of decent restaurants that were handy. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
