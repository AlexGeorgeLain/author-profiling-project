Got a great rate through gta hotels and it was worth every penny! Hotel has great location, a two minute walk (maybe less) to the tube and rail staion. Great for us, as we were wanting to get to different area's of London in the same day. Room was a little on the small side, but this was expected (from reviews on t.advisor), very modern, very clean and had all amenities, iron, hairdryer etc.Staff were really helpful and the breakfast was amazing! Plenty of choice and very fresh!On waiting to check in we took a walk around the area and found a fabulous food market round the corner, Southwalk Market (I think) which is just not to be missed! It was just perfect for a leisurely stroll around the amazing stalls and to sample some great food and sights!Oh, and if you want fish and chips later on, there's a chippy on the corner that's great and when you ask for loads of salt and vinegar they do it! Smashing!
