A friendly and helpful front desk and service thoughout the resort, most of whom do know some english. The grounds, beach and flora are fabulous and the groundscrew and gardeners keeps the resort looking great around the clock, making your experience even more worthwhile. The food was good for the most part but not top-notch. The buffet restaurant is huge with lots to offer and the 24 hr beach/snack bar was great for after hours. The lobby bar, cool place to hang out and meet alot of people. Tokio is by far the best dinner restaurant on the resort. Very entertaining chefs. Book early in your trip, you will want to eat there again if you like it. Nightly entertainment was different every night and enjoyable. While I liked my stay alot, be aware that the resort does let in the locals on the weekends, whom basically took over the pool bar and beachside restaurant on saturday. Also, prepare to barter alot, as the resort lets in area vendors/crafters basically every other night from roughly 6pm-10. There are also alot of renovations going on on the west side of the resort, but none of this should deter you from having a great time. Overall, the resort was definitely worth the money I paid for it and I would go back.
