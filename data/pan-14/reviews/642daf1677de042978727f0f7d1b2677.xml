The Royal Service Plan includes continental breakfast, snacks, and cocktails from 6-8pm. The service also has a private check-in and check-out on the 12th floor. The complaints I have is that I didn't get the service which I paid for. I was tipping extra on room service when I found out at check-out that I was being charged for tip everytime I ordered. The breakfast was really bad, they should go visit the Marquis Reforma and get some tips from their breakfast buffett!! On the Royal Service lounge, they only have one PC for internet access. The only person that was professional and courteous was Elizabeth and Thank You soo much for your understanding. I was traveling with my wife and kids 3yr old daugher and 19 month old son. Anyone traveling to Mexico City should look up the JW Marriott and the Marquis Reforma. I have other complaints about the Royal Service Staff that I will not go into.
