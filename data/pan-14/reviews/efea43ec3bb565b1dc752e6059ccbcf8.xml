It is in a quiet street (trust me you want that in Florence) and from the front looks unexciting. But once inside it is quite lovely, great rooms and super service.It is an old convent and much more interesting than any chain hotel. Good value for money in Florence.I would stay there again without doubt.

Good rooms with great space and fantastic beds.Location is great. We ate at O'Neills the steakhouse joined to the hotel (they also serve breakfast). I had the best steak I have eaten in years and superb service. I would highly commend both the hotel and restaurant. As and earlier reviewer mentions, if you are looking for modern chic this is not the place as it is a very traditional hotel. All in all a great place and one of the biggest suite we have had in any hotel. They also have access to a local gym and health club which was a nice bonus.
