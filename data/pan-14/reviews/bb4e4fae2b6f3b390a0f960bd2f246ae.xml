To say they could care less about the room tempertature ( two of the three rooms were never below 30), making airline confirmations, getting a shuttle to the airport would be right-on. We stayed in six hotels in Spain and Portugal in the same price range and this by far was the worst experience. This hotel should be avoided at all costs. Perhaps it will be better by 2008 !
