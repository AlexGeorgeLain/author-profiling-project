We came from Boston for the funeral of my brother. Upon arrival, we were very tired and worn out based on the circumstances. On checking in, we specifically asked at the desk for a quiet room and were assured that would be the case. We were given rooms in between (as it turned out) a noisy family with children. We were disturbed on both nights with crying, the the adjoining door, and loud talking and television. We tried to be patient, but my cousin finally knocked on their door and asked them to control their children and quiet down. It helped some.In addition, I ordered a side order of toast from Room Service both mornings. The first morning the toast came, barely toasted, on a plate covered by a paper napkin, with no jelly, no knife and no napkins. I called back to ask for these basic items. On Friday morning, the toast came with jelly but no knife and no napkins. Ob check-out, we complained and were given a $25 discount. I followed up with the manager and was offered a free night on our next stay. Since we will never again be in Studio City, I found that unacceptable and asked for a credit. After many follow-up emails and a very long delay, the manager offered another $25 discount, gain, not acceptable. Hence I have decided to post a review.Aside from our specific complaints, Lodge is an old and tired motel looks it and acts it, shabby around the edges, etc. It is one to be avoided.
