We had stayed in the countryside before spending the last 3 nights in Paris. We loved the countryside, and did not expect to have as quiet and restful sleeping quarters once we got to Paris. The Mayfair was a surprise. Not only was it truly quiet, though in the heart of town, it was beautifully appointed and the bed was wonderful. We could walk everywhere from the location. The staff was helpful and friendly. This will be a place we definitely come back to.
