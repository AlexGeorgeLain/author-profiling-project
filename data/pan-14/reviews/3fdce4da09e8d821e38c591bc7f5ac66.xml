It boasts an excellent location with minutes o the bustling city center and shopping close by. The room was not bad, pretty nice, nothing fancy like a W or Westin though - but very god for the price we paid. If breakfast is not included in your room rate then do ot go into the hotel restaurant to have brekkie as it is expensive at S$42 per head. Rather go to Starbucks or other nice breakfast eateries nearby.
