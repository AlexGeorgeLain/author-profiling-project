This is not a cheap hotel and if you're on a business trip, no desk is ridiculous. It turns out there are double bedded rooms with desks, and the staff at the front desk politely allowed me to change rooms.The room with 1 double bed was equally as tiny. I discovered the TV behind the large basket of in-room food and moved the food into the closet. It was nice to have a bathroom gown, however, it disappeared after the first night and was not replaced. The phone next to the bed didn't work. Yes the decor is wonderfully boutique and there is free wireless, but I don't think I'll be back..

I loved this hotel!I stayed for business and found the trendy decor and large plush rooms a pleasure to come back to after a long day. This is not your cookie cutter hotel . It offers cosy duvet's on the bed and W style decor but rooms that are double the size.High service touches included gourmet cookies provided with turndown and each morning providing an East Coast paper for this East Coast Resident (the New York Times). I was reluctant to stay at the hotel given some negative reviews but had no choice as other hotels were booked out. I'm so glad I stayed and shall definitely return.
