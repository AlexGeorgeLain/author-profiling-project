Our honeymoon suite didn't mean for honeymooners. All it meant was it was on the lower level with no concrete between you and the pool. The room was DIRTY and had many ants. It took 3 requests to clean the bedsheets. They told us they were, but they just folded the sheet over. The cig burns let us know they were the same sheets. The 3rd and final time, they found them in the hallway! They finally got the point! It just wasn't what we were expecting...The food was pretty good, there were 7 places to choose from. Dress code (no shorts or bermuda) is required at 3 of them, not including the breakfast buffet. You could go for dinner and literally order 3 meals per person. If you wanted to sample things.The pool was big, but crowded especially with children. Punta Cana is a great place to visit. It is still being heavily developed. We won't go back for a while, but we will eventually return. Take cash because the front desk only had cash on check in day. I would recommend tipping with cash 1 or 2 bucks here and there even though it is all included. Your service is much better and they will come pool side to serve you more often.
