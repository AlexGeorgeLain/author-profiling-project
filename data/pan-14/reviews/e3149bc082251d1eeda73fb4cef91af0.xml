Our stay in Oahu was brief (2.5 days, two nights). I based my hotel pick via tripadvisor and so I chose Aqua Palms and Spa. The hotel is relatively recently renovated. Location: a decent 15minutes walk to the Waikiki beach (we walked through the Hilton huge complex (shopping village/hotel) across the street to get to the beach. The hotel faces a construction building. Otherwise, not near the central bustle of Waikiki. It's like a hotel at the end of the Las Vegas Strip.Hotel: The staff was friendly especially Mark with helping us get taxis. The front desk was friendly too. However, not much help in terms of things to do, places to eat, etc... recommendations. Kept referring to the concierge. The room was nice and comfortable. However, the kingsize bed is actually a queen size bed. The place was overall nice. Near a convenience ABC store. The coffeeshop/diner down the block was always packed. Tasted good and cheap ($10 or less per person).Concierge: Luckily, I've been to Oahu before. The concierge reminded me of a slimy Joe Pantoliano/scam artist style. Very rude. Would make you wait forever to help you. He appeared to have the ability to serve only one couple at a time. We were lucky enough to get a map of Oahu/Waikiki from him. Our guide book was way better than him. Overall, place was decent. But we would look into other hotels next time.
