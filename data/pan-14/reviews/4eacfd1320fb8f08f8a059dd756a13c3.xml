We were fortunate to receive a complimentary upgrade when we checked in and had a huge room overlooking the patio. The hotel staff, from desk clerks to concierge, doormen, bellmen, even servers in the breakfast room and Clock Bar were without doubt the nicest group we have ever encountered, and we travel a great deal. They were friendly and extremely accommodating. The location is excellent (half block from Bourbon St.; rear entrance on Canal). Be sure to try Deanie's just across the street for excellent seafood.
