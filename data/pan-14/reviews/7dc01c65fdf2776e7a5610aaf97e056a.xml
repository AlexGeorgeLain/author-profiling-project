We got a good late deal price from an online holiday shop. I would recommend this hotel. It's in a brilliant location, close to the main shopping area and not too far to walk to the main square and Palacio Real, in fact you can walk most places even to the Prado and other galleries but this is a longer walk! Having said that the street was not noisy and we were able to sleep well in the comfort of air conditioning - I'm sure this is essential for August! The hotel is smart and stylish and feels very clean. The rooms are spacious enough with cool wooden floors, marble bathroom and modern wooden furniture. The shower was lovely - quite powerful and we had a bidet too. Plus, it's true the mini bar is totally free! Obviously it's not full of spirits but there was a couple of beers, soft drinks, fruit juice and mineral water which were replaced each day when we had drunk them! Staff were very friendly and helpful and most spoke good english. On the down side, our breakfast was not included and seemed expensive - we went to a cafe down the road for some toast coffee instead. It's a shame that the hotel hasn't more of a lounge/bar space to sit in the evening (there is a bar in the restaurant) but there is so much choice close by in the city that perhaps you wouldn't use it anyway. The roof terrace was interesting to go and see though far too hot to stay out there - no chairs either.This hotel is a good choice for Couples, Business travellers and families alike.
