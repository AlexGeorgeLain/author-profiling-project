Once you have accepted the generally high prices for hotels in Paris, then there is nothing negative to say about this hotel. Au contraire: it's great!Very friendly hotel staff. Super clean rooms.Good food (try have breakfast in the room with view on the Eiffel tower!)Themed rooms (every room seems to be different), great decor.Good location (100m to the metro, 20min to the train station nord/est)The only negative thing would be the very slow lift....but does that really matter?Anyway, try to get a room on the upper floor, street side. And there is one room which has a baclony and Tour Eiffel view for unforgettable breakfasts)If I am in Paris again, I know where I will stay.
