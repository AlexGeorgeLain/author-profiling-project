There's a living area separate from the big comfortable bed, and also a separate office area....the bathroom was huge ase well. The room was extremely comfortable and the decorations are very classy. The location is right by the Sony Center but a bit far from the main shopping area. I would stay at this hotel again when I visit Berlin...the size of the rooms can't be beat in Europe.

The price is unbeatable for its location. If you're not spending too much time in the hotel or on a very short stay, this would be an excellent choice, if you're looking for a romantic getaway or staying in Florence for extended period, I would opt for higher end hotels. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful, cleansiness is average, I would use my own towels. Quality of room varies, I've stayed in standard and also the deluxe, the A/C unit in my deluxe room was very weak and didn't improve after help from hotel staff. The wireless internet in our room never worked on all my stays and they can't provide cables, there is a small business center for internet on the 2nd floor. If you're just looking for good location, this is it. The quality is lacking, but it's a 3 star hotel so it's expected. I would rank this as a better 3 star hotel in Europe than most.
