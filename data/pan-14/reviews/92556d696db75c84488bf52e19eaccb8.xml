The room was spotless, the bed excellent, the bathroom large and clean with separate tub and shower. The pool on the 10th floor was exceptionally clean and pleasant. As others have mentioned, the entrance is a bit odd. You enter off Market Street between entrances to Myer's Department Store, then take an elevator to the 8th floor. But no matter. Book directly from the Swissotel website for the best prices.
