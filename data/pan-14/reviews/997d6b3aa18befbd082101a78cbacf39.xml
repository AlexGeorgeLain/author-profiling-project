We had a fantastic experience. The owners and staff of this family-run hotel are the most helpful and friendly front office people I can remember in all of my considerable travels! They made our museum reservations, helped with tips on using the local bus system, suggested less-well-known places to visit, gave great recommendations for nearby restaurants that were so good we repeatedly went back! The hotel is clean and tidy, and the family is very proud of their hotel. The location is perfect - between the Accademia and Duomo and only minutes to each, with a bus station right in front of the hotel for places further away. The restaurants they recommended are all less than 5 minutes away. There is free internet in the lobby as well. We will definitely go back to Hotel Casci the next time we're in Florence!
