Hotel opened up resources to outsiders on weekends, so you spent your time waiting to be served or dodging children in pools. Also observed staff taking cutlery from one dining table which just finished and placing it on another, not too hygenic, made sure to wash utensils before using.Hotel and staff very pleasant. Hotel was rated when I went as a 4 Star, to me it is 2 Star at best.
