Paddys Market is at the end of the road.The hotel room we had was very nice, large and well furnished, the facilities at the hotel are good. This is a large hotel, unfortunately our room on the first floor at the front of the building had the monorail right outside the window. Advise you ask for a room on a higher level or away from the front of the building.Sydney has so much to offer its hard to know were to start. We climbed the bridge, went on the ferry to Manly, visited the botanical gardens etc ,etc.

The hotel is outside the main city area and has a good car park. We arrived at the hotel parked the car and caught the bus into Florence right outside the hotel, any 23 going in but 23A coming back.The room was ok but the reception staff were miserable.Did eat in the hotel. It was expensive for a very poor meal. I recommend you eat out.Expensive for what it is.
