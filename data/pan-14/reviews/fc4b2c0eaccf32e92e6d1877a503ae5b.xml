The room was very clean and the beds comfy. The bathroom looked like it was some kind of space capsule - it was all plastic surfaces and looked like it had been added to the room in one piece (sorry it's hard to explain - i wish I'd taken a picture). The hotel is well located and easy walking distance to most of the major sights. The breakfast was included and was OK but nothing special. Nearby parking was outrageously expensive. The first place we came to was Falcon Parking which was EUR 30 for 24 hours and we thought that was a bit steep but then the next place was EUR45 for 24 hours so we went back to the first place which is cloest the Ibis anyway! I think next time we go to Amsterdam we might stay further out of town but near public transport as it would be a bit cheaper.
