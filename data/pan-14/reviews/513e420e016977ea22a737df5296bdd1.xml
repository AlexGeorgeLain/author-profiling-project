However, when running a conference last year, I decided to join the VIP guests and try it out.I remember Raffles when it was a charmingly-tatty old place, with staff that may well have been recruited by the Sarkies, when they built the joint. When it was 'renovated' I sidelined it as even a place to recommend to friends, on the grounds that it looked like a well-disguised shopping centre with rooms.I WAS TOTALLY WRONG. This may be the best hotel in the world. If you want a taste of 'colonial' living, with none of the obsequiousness that the word suggests, you simply have to go here. Even if you don't particularly like Singapore, go here. Before you die, fellow trippers, go here.If you want super-trendy, stay away. If you want up-to-the-moment decor, stay away. If you want a cool pool-scene, and an in-house disco, give it a miss.There's absolutely no point in going into details beyond that. The amazing staff and the look and feel of the place are unique. There's nowhere else on earth I prefer...with the possible exception of Singita or Londolozi in S.Africa, but then the criteria are different there.Here's the kicker: my much-travelled son is ten, and it's HIS favourite place in the world as well.Some of the bars and restaurants are better than others, and none of them is The Best Place in Town...but Singapore is full of brilliant food and booze, so who cares? Raffles has the knack of making you feel like the only guest in the place, or at least the most important.I'm seriously thinking about selling my house, and moving in here.
