The location can not be beat, as it is so close to walk to museums, food and tourist sites. But the place is really suffering through the renovations. Our room was mostly clean and they kept the loud construction noise to decent hours. Try to negotiate a lower price with the hotel directly. When it is finished this place will be fabulous and probably very expensive.
