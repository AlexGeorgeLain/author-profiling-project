All the staff were attentive and the room I had (suite) was great, perhaps a little noisy but it is in a busy city ! If I had a complaint, it would be that they do not use the air con until May, so if you get hot like I did, you will have to open the window but be prepared to be bitten big time by the mosquitoes !
