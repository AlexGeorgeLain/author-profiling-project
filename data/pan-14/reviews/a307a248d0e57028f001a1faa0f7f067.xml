The Staff were VERY helpful, even upgrading our rooms to spectacular river views. They told us where we could quickly get stocked up with all the things BA had lost.The breakfast is excellent with all the usual buffet items, what was a very nice surprise was the 'cooked' Breakfast... great bacon and sausages with Fresh Scrambled eggs.FREE Internet connection in every room and use of laptops if you need them.We had a wonderful stay and will DEFINITELY return.
