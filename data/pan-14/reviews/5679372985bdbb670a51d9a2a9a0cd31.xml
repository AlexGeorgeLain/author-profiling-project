Beware of the bill for parking and telephone, be sure to ask what each individual call would cost!! I ended up paying $70 for a 2 minute long distance phone call!!Hotel is located in a nice area near bayside mall and the american airlines arena with good access to all areas of Miami.Hotel is about a 25 minute ride from the airport with about $20-$25.Room Service food was average and the bathroom looks a little outdated. Great front desk staff!!
