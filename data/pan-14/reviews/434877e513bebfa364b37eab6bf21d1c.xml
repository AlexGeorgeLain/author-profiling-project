The room was a nice size, lovely views of the the city, waterways.The room had a small kitchen with cooker, fridge/freezer and microwave, lots of cupboards.No worktop space which was problem as you had nowhere to drain washing up or prepare meals.The beds were bouncy,we got used to it.Great Colour t.v with over 90 channels to chose from. A clock radio . The bathroom was a nice size, clean, towels soft and changed daily. The lighting was dim which was a problem if you wanted to read, even with the bedside lights on it didnt make much diference.There is a inroom safe which you get charged $3.00 a night whether you use it or not.The pool was of nice size and you could walk out of the gate right on to the beach which is lovely. The staff were friendly and helpful. There is a little shop that provides essentials, but is way overpriced. There is a supermarket approx 0.5 miles away which is brilliant, plus other shops, resturants along the road. Public transport in Miami is very good. The S bus takes you to Adventura mall north miami or to Lincoln road mall south miami. $1.50 per person, you must have the correct money. If you want to go the Sea aquaruim you take the S bus, South, stay on this bus till the last stop and then get the B bus to KeyBiscaye. You will see signs for the Aquaruim. All the bus routes had amazing views.The Cassablanca was ok, But I would try another hotel if I came to Miami again.
