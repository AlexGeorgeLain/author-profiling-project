The location of the hotel is great, right next to a large shopping mall with direct access to the MTR. We could not fault the staff who were always available to answer any query. We went on the hotel free 1 hour evening guided tour of local markets which was informative. The pool was excellent with wonderful views over Hong Kong skyline. Ask for a high room for wonderful views - this hotel would not be good for guests suffering from vertigo! The glass wall between the en-suite bathroom and bedroom was a bit of a shock until we realised there was a blind to pull down! The restaurant and bar are expensive but very good. Plenty of other eating options in the adjacent shopping mall.We had a 5am departure and ordered breakfast in our room at 4.15am, it arrived bang on time and beautifully presented. We would not hesitate to stay at this lovely hotel again.
