This was probably not the best time to stay here, particularly on the fourth floor. Needing to keep the windows open led to a lot of noise from the typical Amsterdam nightlife below. However, this hotel did give us an exceelnt base from which to explore Amsterdam as there are many dining, drinking, and tourist options within 5 minutes and many more within 10 to 15 minutes.The room on the far end of floor four was average. The floor tilted across the room, making for an uncomfartable night on the like-tilted bed. Even by European standards, it was a pretty small room ... the door hit the side of the bed as we entered!Its not a bad hotel and the location is guaranteed to please. We found the staff to be helpful and the lift helps tremendously.
