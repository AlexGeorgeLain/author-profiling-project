Ok, the rooms are a little small and the bathrooms don't have a lock but these are minor grumbles. The decor is cool, staff really friendly, rooms are comfortable and quiet and the bar serves good bourbon. What more can you want? Oh, and the locations is fantastic- 5 minutes from the tube and all you need to do to reach the bars of Old Street is fall out of bed. Also, you get Pret breakfast delivered to your room in the morning, which is a nice touch. Can't wait to stay here again.
