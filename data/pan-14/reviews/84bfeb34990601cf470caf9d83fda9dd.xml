We are both 22, incase people think age matters with these reviews. We stayed in a Jr.Suite because when we booked our trip the normal rooms and the jr. rooms where the same price. I would definitely get a jr. suite if I went again. I loved almost everything about the resort. The only complaint I have is the check in system, which other reviewers have also complained about. However, since the only problem was that it took a little while to check into the room, I really dont see it as an issue that would keep be from going back. The beach and pool and whole resort area was so clean and well kept. We walked for a good hour or 2 in both directions along the beach (walk onto the other resorts beaches) and we by far had one of the nicest locations. Food was great. I'm allergic to just about everything and I even found great food to eat! We ate at the Brazillian, Italian and mexican resturants and really enjoyed it all.Oo and just like another reviewer had said. DO go to you're orrientation. I found it was quite helpful!CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!
