The locationis great -- close to the bus terminal for transportation to/from the airport and cruise terminal. (Only needed to carry our luggage acrosstwo bridges.) It's a bit of a walk to the major attractions, but veryclose to the vaparetto stop. On the other hand, the neighborhood isn't nearly as crazy crowded as those nearer to San Marco.The staff couldn't have been nicer. Very friendly and helpful, excellent English. Gave us recommendations for restaurants in the area and good advice on how to get around.The rooms are fairly small, typical of Europe. Three of us were givena small suite in a beautifully renovated annex just down the calle from the main building. It had a bedroom and separate living room with a sofa bed. Perfect for us. (Not a lot of room for luggage, however.)The only problem was the shower in the bathroom which had no bracket for hanging the hose. Rather awkward. The staff assured us this will be fixed soon -- now that the August everything closes down in Italy season is over.All in all, we all enjoyed this hotel very much and highly recommend it.
