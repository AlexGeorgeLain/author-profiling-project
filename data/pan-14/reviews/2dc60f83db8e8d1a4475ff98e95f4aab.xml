The hotel is a straight shot from the airport and easy to find. Rail construction in the street out front caused some backtracking, but I assume that is finished by now. Parking is ample, although you do have to walk around to the front entrance after the back door is locked.The hotel has been undergoing renovations, which appeared to be mostly complete. Our room was quite large and spacious, and very comfortable. We ate at the restaurant on premises, as we just wanted to crash after the flight, and it was quite decent.We booked this stay on a web site that offered a VERY good rate considering the excellent room -- I forget how much exactly but I think it was about $80. The hotel was not very busy at that time, and I observed that a walk-in customer who was ahead of me actually got an even lower rate than I did. I imagine rate flexibility depends on what's going on in town, convention business, etc, so you might not find that low a rate all the time. I would try it again, if we do a similar itinerary.
