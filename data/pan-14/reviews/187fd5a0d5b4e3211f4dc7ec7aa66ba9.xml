We had a room in the back which overlooked an art institute. We had a birds-eye view in the morning of art students painting, sculpting, etc. in the studios and patios of the school.The room was huge and had a very modern bathroom and a good air conditioner (important in Jul/Aug in Florence). The staff were very helpful and the breakfast buffet was first-rate.One of the previous reviewers was put off by the lack of life in the piazza in front of the hotel. This lack of activity at night was *exactly* the reason we wanted to be in this hotel. The last time we stayed in Florence we were in a hotel on a busy square with plenty of nightlife -- which went on until 4 a.m. and which was very audible from our room. Another review mentioned vagrants on the street. It's true, there were a couple of down-and-out types hanging around but they were easily ignored. Anyone who has traveled to any large American or European city should (sadly) be used to this.We will definitely go back to this place the next time we're in Florence.
