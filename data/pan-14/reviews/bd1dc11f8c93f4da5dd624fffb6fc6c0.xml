Having read all the reviews on Trip Advisor, I went there with high expectations and wasn't at all disappointed. I kept being reminded of the things other people had said, from the fresh fruit and ice water around the pool to the cool mist sprays and the delicious food and wonderful service. I especially enjoyed the music at night on the patio, and the awesome chocolate martinis. I don't want to repeat over and over what everyone else has raved about, but I have to mention how friendly and helpful the entire staff was. We were treated like royalty. The hotel is simply beautiful and I would highly recommend it.

I always read reviews on TripAdvisor website before I book a hotel, especially in Miami, because they vary widely, and trusted the positive reviews. We were just delighted with this hotel. The rooms were very nicely furnished and didn't seem like a budget hotel. We enjoyed the pool and the breakfast. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The best part was the price was very reasonable, hard to find in Miami. I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel.
