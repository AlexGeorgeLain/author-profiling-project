We booked the St. Louis through ------ approximtely nine months before our arrival and confirmed the day before leaving California. When we arrived, we were told that the St. Louis had overbooked because of a wedding party. At least five other couples shared our experience of having their rooms given away and personnel at the St. Louis acted as if this were perfectly routine. The St. Louis refused a refund but offered rooms at their sister hotel the St. Ann. This hotel is the filthiest place I have ever been in. We were unable to use the shower due to mold; phones were nonfunctional and the carpet was covered with stains. From reading comments about hotels as well as the St. Louis, this doesn't appear to be an isolated incident.
