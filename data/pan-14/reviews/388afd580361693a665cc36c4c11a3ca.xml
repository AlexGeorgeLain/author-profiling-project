A Metro stop is one block away. Plenty of restaurants nearby, though most cater to tourists. 15 minute walk to coast. I stayed in a single room that was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only complaint is that it can be noisy at night from the streets below. I would stay here again.

I visited as a single traveller, and I was actually given a really good room. It was far from the elevator (so it was quiet), was one of the largest rooms on the floor (based on the floorplan), and overlooked George Street. The room was extremely clean and the housekeepers very friendly. The concierge was super helpful and friendly, and delivered the newspaper to me daily for free. The location of the hotel is great, as it is located on George Street, one of the main streets in Sydney, and is right across the street from the Central Railway station, making rail transporation really convenient. The hotel is within walking distance to Chinatown, Haymarket, Darling Harbour, Glebe, and the central shopping area i.e. Pitt Street Mall. And since I shopped a lot, it was easy to hop on a train back to central station rather than walk with all my bags. I would definitely stay here again.
