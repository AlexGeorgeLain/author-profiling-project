The room was nice, nothing fancy, but spacious enough. The tub/shower was a little weird- hand-held shower head's cord was not long enough to fit in the overhead holder, made it kind of difficult to bathe comfortably, but workable. Breakfast was adequate and the staff was outstanding, very willing to discuss local restaurants and provide other information. They also have an extensive collection of travel books and other guides to browse over breakfast or whenever. Right next to Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio. Would definitely recommend for the budget traveler looking for a great deal and location!
