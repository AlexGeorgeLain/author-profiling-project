I'd have hated to see it before the work!It's an okay hotel, obviously quite classy when first built but now very tired and dull, everything's brown or beige and dark. The staff hardly speak any English at all which for a hotel advertising itself as ideal for business people and tourists seems a bit odd. The cleaning of the rooms was half hearted and hardly thorough - in and out in minutes, barely enough time to make the bed. And the decor is very tired and tatty in places.That said, it's ideally located for exploring Beijing and the food isn't bad.

And the massive collection of art around the hotel is fantastic.The executive lounge is well worth the extra money. All day snacks and drinks, with stunning view. And the Spa is one of the best I have visited anywhere in the world.
