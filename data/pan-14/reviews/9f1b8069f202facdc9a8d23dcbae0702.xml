And the noise level at reception foyer so loud I couldn't hear the receptionist because of the awful acoustic plus a thumping pianiste. It was always crowded too noisy as was the first floor restaurant where food was just average. The fact that Singapore has full employment was reflected in the disinterested attitude of the men looking after luggage .Once on the 58 floor excellent - large well serviced room with a great harbor view. Most obliging helpful room staff.Will stay again because of its location but avoid the foyer as much as possible.
