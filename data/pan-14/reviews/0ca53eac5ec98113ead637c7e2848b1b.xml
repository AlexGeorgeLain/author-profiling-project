I personally have stayed at the Fairmont multiple times prior, but the last time was 6 years ago, so this experience seemed new to me as well. Everything and everyone we encountered at the Fairmont was first class. The timeless elegance of the Grand Lobby envelopes you in opulence without feeling stiff or too cold. Our arrival was processed swiftly and efficiently and we were ensconced in our room with our luggage within 10 minutes of walking through the doors, even though we arrived over 2 hours prior to the official check in time. I'm a member of the President's Club, so we were upgraded without asking to a corner room on the 9th floor of the Tower Building, which was just fine with us. I personally would rather have the breathtaking views of the Bay and Coit Tower out of one set of windows and the SOMA district out of the others. The concierge was extremely attentive and helpful with every request as were the room service attendants that we came in contact with. The hotel is located in a great location to traverse the city via any of the many forms of public transit available. The Fairmont truly is a wonderful hotel to stay at whether it be for a special occasion or just a get away from it all weekend. I cannot recommend it highly enough. We will surely be returning here when we come back to beautiful San Francisco again.
