A five minute walk over two bridges gets you to the hotel if you arrive this way.Fantastic location, close to a vaporetto bus stop, gives easy access to everywhere. The hotel and its staff are superb. It and they made the stay unforgettable. Well worth asking for restaurant advice. We were asked... A good view, or good food? We chose the latter and they did not let us down. The hotel was comfortable, clean and welcoming. If you can, stay here.
