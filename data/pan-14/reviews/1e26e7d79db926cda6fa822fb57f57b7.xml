We booked our stay over the internet using the hotel's own website. This was smooth and without any hitches. We also booked a limo from the hotel to pick us up from the airport. Our pick up was there to meet us on time and was friendly, efficient and courteous. The check in process was also very smooth. We booked a club suite with a harbor view. It was excellent and the view was suberb. Since we arrived very early, our first meal was breakfast. The range of food and fruits available in the restaurant is one of the best I have ever seen. On subsequent days we had breakfast in the club lounge which was also very very good. The hotel is connected to a great shopping mall and my wife spent many happy hours there. The complimentary afternoon tea in the club lounge of the hotel is a great way to relax after a morning of shopping. There are a number of good restaurants around the hotel and we tended to have breakfast and afternoon tea in the hotel and all other meals outside the hotel. The staff of this hotel are excellent and the level of service of a very high standard. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.
