Took a taxi from the airport at 35 euros saves all the hassle. They let us check in early but the superior room was overlooking an interior courtyard with scaffolding! A quick phone call later and we were given 2nd floor room overlooking the square which was only available later .No problem by the time we had returned our bags had been moved for us. Staff were excellent and the concierge brilliant at pointing us in the right direction. HIRE BIKES! just around the corner for 10 euros. There are great eating places around the hotel and dont miss the Bulldog coffee shop for some smoke ( 5mins way ).Although the Bulldog is touristy we loved the vibe and freindly crowd.Took the Blue Boat Canal dinner cruise opposite the hotel for a 2 hour candle lit tour. Although the meal was pre-prepared it was really good and served by freindly staff with as much booze as you could drink! The location is great for cycling into the city and park. All in all a great weekend but HIRE BIKES to save blisters!
