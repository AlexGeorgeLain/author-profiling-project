We waited at the lobby along with 5 other guests until 3pm. Once checked in we were placed to a room across the street on the top floor with no elevator. The TV in the room is facing the vanity instead of the bed, the TV remote dosen't work, neither did the voicemail system, iron and ironing board. The curtain has stains on them and so did the bed spread. We finally argued our ways to switch the room to the side where the front desk is. We will definitely never stay at Ramanda again.
