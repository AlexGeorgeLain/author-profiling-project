I agree with a lot of what others have said about the resort.The meals were ho-hum; we loved the beach but hated the fact that we had to rise before dawn to secure 8 lounges togetherunder a palapa; the weather was wonderful; the ocean was clear; the room was great as was the maid service.My one huge complaint is that when my brother back in the states contracted viral encephalitis and my sister-in-law tried to reach me, the resort did not get the message to me. My daughter called the 2nd day was promised by someone at the front desk that they would get the message to me. It never happen! Finally on the 3rd day my daughter happened to call while I was in the room and told me what happened. Thank God that he was out of the woods by the time she called. He was still in guarded condition so I wanted to speak to him my sister-in-law to assure myself that he was going to be OK. I tried to call from the room but was unable to do so. We went to the front desk to complain and were offered no help regarding the phone other than we could go buy a phone card. The man said he was sorry (his sorry didn't sound very sincere!) but did not respond as one would have hoped in such an emergency situation. The icing on the cake happened on the last day. We were going through all the literature regarding the resort; the blank stationery they leave for your use on the coffee table; etc. In the folder with the stationery was an unmarked envelope with the fax my sister-in-law sent me on the 1st day.
