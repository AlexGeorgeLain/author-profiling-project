From that perspective the location of the hotel is good - within an easy 10-15 minute of Placa Espanya - so no reliance on taxis or public transport. From the tourist's perspective the location isnt great as it isnt too near the majority of attractions. That said it is still pretty central and being right on top of Sants station makes for very easy access to the airport.In terms of decore the hotel is *very* tired, my room having seen much wear and tear. Beds are cheap and hard, not in a pleasantly firm way but with more of a cheap mattress with few springs vibe. My aircon worked, thought that of many of my fellow guests didnt, leading to perpetually freezing or baking rooms.There are many other hotels in Barcelona. I wouldnt recommend picking this one unless proximity to the Fira is your main criteria.
