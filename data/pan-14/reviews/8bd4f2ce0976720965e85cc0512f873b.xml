Trendy slick staff, efficient concierge desk - just what you expect from NYC. Our suite was nicely appointed in shades of blue, grey, and silver. The rooms are very airy and spacious, a rarity for New York. The living room had an elegant but comfy semi-circular couch hugging the window. Loved reading the paper or having a coffee there. Well designed work station -- ample light, sleek and ergonomic chair, and several plug points. A door divided the two rooms, which was nice for privacy. Really great bed and well calculated lighting in the bedroom. Loved that there was a separate dressing room with plenty of space and a huge mirror enough for two. Plenty of space to spread out luggage without making the room messy. The bathroom was nice. Very minimal, but well designed with lots of counter space and lighting. The commode was at the far end of the rectangular bathroom (all the better). The shower space was uber chic but practical space with a shower head at each end for side-by-side showers. Great for a couple in the AM and PM when both have to be somewhere. Not so great if sharing with anyone else! Vur and I loved our 3 night stay
