The halls were bright and clean. The surprise was that even though we booked on hotwire, we were upgraded to a suite with a lovely king bed, walk in closet, and separate sitting room with sofa and dining table. Only downside was that the room was not as soundproofed as it could have been. Traffic noise was audible, though not so bad that it prevented sleep.
