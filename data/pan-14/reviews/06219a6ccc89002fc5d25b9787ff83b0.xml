It was fabulous! It is conveniently located near the waterfront and Fanueil Hall, as well as other Boston landmarks. The lobby is impressive and the RumBa Bar is a happening spot in the evening! We had both breakfast and lunch at their restaurant Miel and it was very good both times. We also had room service which was prompt and the staff was friendly and helpful.The fitness center was a delight with new equipment and you could do both cardio and strength training with everything you need for a decent on the road workout.The bed was comfortable and the pillows were so-so. We had a typical city view with a partial view of the harbor. The bathroom was exceptional with an awesome shower and separate tub. Overall, we were very happy at the Intercontinental and would highly recommend it to travelers.

My husband and I stayed with our two teenagers in the 3-BR/2.5 BA Royal Suite and we were all very comfortable. The Master BR was spacious and the bathrooms were wonderful. The oversized balcony with a canopy was also a nice plus. We appreciated having a washer dryer as we were in the middle of a 2-week vacation in Europe. The location was very convenient to the Metro and the neighborhood seemed very safe. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.
