We usually stay in Midtown and enjoyed being away from the congestion of that area. The sleek black tower was easy to find and next to the WTC site. St. Paul's Church right beside the hotel has some compelling exhibits and stories about 9/11 inside and a very old graveyard that is beautiful and parklike. Good shopping is close by too. My spouse was duly impressed for his 40th birthday. Furnishings are modern, and wow did he love the flat screen tv on the wall. Nice beds too. (I continue to *hate* the fridge with the hugely marked-up items and no room for your own soda or water.) In NYC, you don't spend too much time in the room, but we had a chance to enjoy a bottle of wine while gazing out over Manhattan at night, lovely! We appreciated the wine glasses and corkscrew in the room, and I liked the Crabtree Evelyn toiletries.We did not take advantage of the pool, the lobby bar, or the Church Dey restaurant, too many other things to do. We did notice that there was wireless in the bar and restaurant, and the lobby bar always seemed busy. My husband is a huge subway fan and loved our central location for getting just about any train we needed, from Midtown to Coney Island. The location is extremely convenient. I'd stay here again in a regular room if I could get some of the under-$200 prices that others seem to be snagging. Normally, I go budget, but this place came through for me when I needed a special occasion room without seeing it first. I will continue to wonder why this hotel spells its own name wrong. Don't let that steer you away. :-)
