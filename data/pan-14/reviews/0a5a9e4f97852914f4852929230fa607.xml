It definitely met this criteria and went way beyond!The fantastic customer service made the stay. They never hassled or even commented about our early check-in time. Our room was clean and fitted nicely with modern furnishings and extras like free mini bar and spirits in glass decanters. The bathroom was very nice with a shower and a really long bathtub! Overall we enjoyed our stay.
