The entire experience, from booking our room to check out, was excellent. The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. The food in the Rib Room was wonderful. The staff was pleasant and went out of their way to please. Everything was first class the entire stay. I will never stay anywhere else in New Orleans but the Omni from now on.
