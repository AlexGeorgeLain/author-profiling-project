Staff were friendly and extremely helpful, room was nice, and the inner courtyard/pool was a neat place to chill enjoy wireless access. Also had a fun time because when I checked in on a Sunday the hotel was hosting a pool party, so got to meet some interesting people - but contrary to some of the reviews I had read, the party wrapped up at 8 and other than that the place was really quiet for the rest of the time. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in San Francisco.
