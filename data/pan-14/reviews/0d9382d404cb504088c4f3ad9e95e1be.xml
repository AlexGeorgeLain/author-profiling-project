We took the Bart train over from the Oakland airport and the Bart station was just down the hill. The cable car to Fisherman's Wharf stops right in front of the hotel. If you come to shop Union Square is where you want to stay. The room was clean and the bed was the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. We arrived early and our room was ready. There were 6 elevators and they moved quickly. The only bad things I can think of were the limited TV channels and the dirty window. We will stay at the Drake on our next visit.
