We were pleasantly surprised to find it completely refurbished although the rooms are still quite small. Everything spotless and a friendly staff. A full breakfast is included with is nice. Elevator is still miniscule but adequate. Within a block or two of museums and great upscale shopping. It's out of the tourist loop somewhat which is a real plus if you're not interested in hordes and trinkets.
