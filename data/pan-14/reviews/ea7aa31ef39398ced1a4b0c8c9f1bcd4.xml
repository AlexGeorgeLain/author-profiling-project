The cost was very reasonable compared to other similiar hotels in the Boston area. Parking can be had for free IF you can get parked between the hotel and the bridge, which we were able to do quite easily and with no hassle. Just a 15 minute walk to TD Banknorth Garden, ( the old Fleet Center ) which is where we went to a WHO concert, just 1 night after Santana in Mansfield, to which this hotel offers easy highway access as well. We would certainly stay again without hesitation!! There is, however, not much life near here after midnight, even on the weekends, and please, please, do not under any circumstances order a pizza from the number they give you to call from the desk!! If you do, don't say you were not warned!!! Just a short walk across the bridge will get you to Maurissimos( or something like that ) authentic Italian restaurant, which was truly terrific and very informal. Staff there was extremely efficient and friendly!!
