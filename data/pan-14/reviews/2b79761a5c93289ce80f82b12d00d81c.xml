I made arrangements with the concierge in advance of arrival for some champagne and flowers in the room for my wife's birthday. The instructions were carried out perfectly and to great effect!Room was beautiful and the bath was large and beautifully appointed.The d'Aubusson is in a perfect Left Bank location that is also near the Louvre and other popular Right Bank sights.

Reasonably priced by NYC standards. I previously stayed at the Peninsula but stopped when average room prices topped $1000 with taxes. The Omni Berkshire is slightly less luxurious (no flatscreen in the bathroom) but only slightly----and for much less.

It was exactly what my wife and I had hoped for in a small London hotel. The staff was welcoming, the rooms spacious (except for the bathrooms) and the public rooms especially comfortable. We liked the private back garden a la the movie Notting Hill and the overall sense that you were staying in someone's home.Location is very quiet yet convenient to everything in Knightsbridge and Chelsea. We never waited more than 2-3 minutes for a cab on the closest street corner.We will definitely return to the Draycott.
