Superb position 100yds from the Metro at Placa Catalunya. We had room 212 which was very clean and comfortable also quite large. The bed was huge although maybe a little hard for some. Hotel was very quite and the food for breakfast was excellent with a great choice of hot and cold foods. Most of the main tourist attractions are within working distance, La Rambla for example approx. 200yds away. Plenty of bars, restaurants etc close to hotel. Don't use the train from the airport as you will be put on a shuttle bus which drops you about a mile away from Placa Catalunya and you may not know where you are. This is because they are improving the line and it looks as if it will be like this for some time to come. We booked the hotel on H10's own site which was cheaper than anyone else. GREAT HOTEL!!!!
