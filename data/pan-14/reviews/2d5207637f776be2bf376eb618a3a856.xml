Couple of issues...I planned to lay out by the pool in the 107 degree heat, however, the outside portion of the pool small and shaded by the building. Parking near the hotel was a challenge, uness you want to park near the college administration building. The other issue was with the staff not being able to give accurate directions. The directions given took us about 20 miles out of our way. Other than that, an okay experience but I felt a little cheated because of the pool.
