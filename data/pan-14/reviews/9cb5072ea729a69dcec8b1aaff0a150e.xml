We really liked it's quiet location near Luxembourg Gardens in the 6eme. The entrance and the public rooms are charming. The staff is among the friendliest that we have ever dealt with in Paris.The standard room @ 199E is miniscule, and the carpet in our room, number 20, was badly stained along the foot of the beds (as it turns out, the only place you can really walk inside the room.) The bathroom was adequate and kept meticulously clean.The daily petit dejeuner that comes included with the price of the room became a bit boring and repetitive after a few days, although the room/s in which it is served are lovely. The breakfast consisted of coffee/tea, orange juice and a small basket of bread (baguette, croissant, sweet roll). The addition of fruit and/or yogurt would be a real plus.Although we enjoyed our stay, we will probably look elsewhere when we return next year, possibly an apartment.
