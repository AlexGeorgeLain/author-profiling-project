There are some nice views of the airport. There is a good gym. The staff are friendly and helpful.My only complaint would be that the restaurants and room service are expensive but there are plenty of shops and restaurants at the airport which I use. There is a direct physical connection between the hotel and the airport so it is easy to get across.Clearly this hotel would only be of interest to someone arriving at or leaving the airport first thing in the morning or late at night, or someone working in one of the business parks or towns around Schiphol. No-one would want to stay here on holiday or if they are working in Amsterdam.However, if you are happy with the location, the hotel is great. By far the best at the Schiphol.
