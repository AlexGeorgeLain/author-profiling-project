Elegant decor, very quiet, upscale, with attentive staff who seemed genuinely interested in your stay. Rooms were large with granite countertops, separate bath and shower, truly exquisite furnishings. We had a lovely view of the bay and the Tower.The hotel is one block from convention center, surrounded by incredible shopping and restaurants, and within walking distance of Pike Market.We would definitely go back and only wish we could do so immediately! It is comparable to any Ritz Carlton we have stayed in.
