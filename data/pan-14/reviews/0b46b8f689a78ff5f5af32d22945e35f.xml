Not having been to the region prior, nor knowing anyone who had, we had no idea what to expect. I believe this contributed to some sense of disappointment with this trip. The grounds are beautiful, the place is immaculately clean. The employees are busy, busy, bees... always cleaning, sweeping, replacing, doing their best to maintain everything and they will do everything to attempt to satisfy your needs. The selling point of the resort seems to be the fact that it is all-inclusive; all one can eat and especially drink.The problem for us was 1) the food was terrible, 'tho there was always great effort to present it attractively, and 2) not being heavy drinkers we found little to do other than lounge by the pool . Because of weather conditions (of course the resort had no control over the storm which kept everyone off the beach for two days) the pool area was quite crowded and short of lounging chairs. Not being near even a small city shopping area we never saw much of the life of the country. We did take the one day trip to the Island for beach and BBQ. This trip was nice, but way too long. It was a 2-hr bus ride to the marina where we boarded a catamaran. Following our time on the beach we had another looong return ride to the hotel. Whew!Families with small children seemed to have a good time with the youngsters being able to plop around the pool; and certainly the hearty drinkers enjoyed the never empty glass of whatever it was they wanted to drink. My advice then, would be to take a good book or two, snag a lounge chair, just relax, read, and drink up. For us, it just wasn't enough.
