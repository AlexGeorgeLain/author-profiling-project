The definite pluses were the location and the friendliness of the staff. At check out time, they would store your bags which gave us time to tour the town without worrying about what to do with our bags. Even at the end of our stay, the manager loaded our luggage onto the cab for us. The rooms were definitely small and vary amongst other rooms. We ended up with a corner room which was significantly smaller but the same price as the other larger rooms our friends had. I was able to note this to management and they gave me a reduction in the price. In addition, do ask for a room in the middle of the hotel and not an outside room. It was very noisy during the middle of the night with all the bars close by. Overall for a one night stay it was very nice because everything was within walking distance. The only area that wasn't close by were the casinos which you would need to take a short cab ride to.
