The staff is wonderful and the resort is clean.We were pinks, but we did not like our rooms they were along the back side facing the black fence and other resort. The smell was terrible. Sunday we moved to rooms on the floor facing the interior of the resort. It was our choice not to have the suites, just so that we could get some view of the ocean , and rooms side by side.Danny V and Robert at the VIP family bar was amazing. They were alot of fun and keep the activity level up. Very entertaining.The language barrier was fun, we learned alot from each other.I was surprised that as new as the resort is, that there is always fresh paint and replacing broken tiles being done, Alot ot upkeep at the time. The grounds were lush and in a few years, I can only imagine what it is going to look like.The chairs was still continued, but oh well, if they want to ruin their time looking and fighting over chairs, so be it. Not worth it for us. We were either in the pool, ocean or at the bar. And still got plenty of sun.Really miss the resort and wish I was still there. Do one should be disappointed when they returned.
