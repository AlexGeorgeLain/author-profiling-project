On expedia it stated that you would get 2 bedrooms with queen sized beds and a sofa bed in the living room.... Instead master bedroom w/ queen sized bed w/ master bath attatched, a small children's bedroom w/ a double bed and a small love seat w/ no pull out... this did not work very well as there were 2 couples and a friend of ours who drove from west palm beach and was hoping to sleep on a sofe bed ended up sleeping on a love seat..... the kitchen advertised was big however there were absolutely no cutlery, glasses, pots or pan...Room service was useless and did not speak english very well..... the worst part of it all is that the room was filthy... the floors looked like they haven't been mopped in months and the bath tub mouldings were molding....they clean your room every second day and all they really do is change your towels I don't even think they wipped any thing down..
