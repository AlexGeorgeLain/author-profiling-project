While clean and acceptable, they were dated, the wallpaper in the entry didn't match the wallpaper in the part of the room where the beds were. The tub was a little dingy. We had an ocean view balcony and the wind was making all this stuff on the balcony above us fly around and make noise, so we phone front desk to access the situation, they never called us back, it was a fitful sleep, but in their defense there was a tornado warning so winds were high. The lobby is beautiful though, but don't expect the rooms to match the decor. For the price and location I would definetly stay again, but with lower expectations upon entering the lobby.
