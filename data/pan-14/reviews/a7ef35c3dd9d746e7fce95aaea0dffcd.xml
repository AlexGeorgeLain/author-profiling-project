We booked a double room but got a twin one, the first thing which didn't go as planned. There was also told we had an own toilet and shower, this wasn't the case. The room was dirty, the breakfast was crappy and the fact we had to do our own dishes was the most ridiculous thing one can imagine in a hotel. The only good thing was the location, but there are also other hotels with a good location, they will never see me at this hotel again. Don't go there!
