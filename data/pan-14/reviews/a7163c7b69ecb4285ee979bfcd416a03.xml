Very comfy beds, bathrobes okay if you are a size 8 or below or don't mind revealing all!I wouldn't recommend the Romantic package - really not worth the extra and the restaurant is not conducive to romance - too sparse! Although the pretty food is okay (international not spanish) - there are much better restaurant in close proximity.Would return and would recommend, bit on the pricey side - but Barcelona is not a cheap place to go.
