The hotel is ideally located for the aerobus with the Universitat bus stop only a few hundred metres from the hotel. The location is perfect, about a 10 minute stroll to Placa de Catalunya and La Ramblas. The area around the hotel is perfectly safe and we were quite happy walking back around midnight to the hotel. We was a bit worried that it might be a bit noisy from what we had read from other reports but we had a room on the 3rd floor and we had no complaints about any noise.We paid 85 euros a night without breakfast which for the location and quality of the hotel was excellent value for money. The rooms were a good size and very clean.I would highly recommend this hotel.
