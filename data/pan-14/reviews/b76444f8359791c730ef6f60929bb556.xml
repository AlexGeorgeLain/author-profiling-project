We reserved a small room with two single beds but were upgraded to a deluxe room. We were in a corner room with a view of the Puget sound. The rooms were clean and the desk personnel were great and very helpful for touring. It is very short walk to the water front area. There are several great restaurants within walking distance.A great place to stay in Seattle.
