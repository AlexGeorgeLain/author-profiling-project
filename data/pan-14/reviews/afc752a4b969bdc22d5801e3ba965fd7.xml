Four years ago we stayed at Allegro Punta Cana it was fine but this resort is better. Food was very good. Staff was friendly. We love Bavaro Beach. There is not much activity in this region to go outside of the resort but we knew we just wanted to relax this trip. If you like to walk the beach, you can walk forever.
