The lobby/hallway/and conference rooms were cold the first few days but the situation was tended to quickly by the staff and resolved. I had a lovely corner room on the 17th floor with a view to the north and east. As others have said, the cable car is just around the corner and there were lots of great restaurants very close by. Disappointed in Pier 39 - stereotypical tourist trap with no real substance. Would stay here again. Very attentive and responsive staff.
