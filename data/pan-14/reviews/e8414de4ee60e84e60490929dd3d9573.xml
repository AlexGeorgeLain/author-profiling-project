It was not so easy to find, in spite of directions, but we chose it because parking was simple. When we arrived in the evening and were shown our room (closest to the desk), my heart sank. I hoped that the double doors might be closed for noise, but they never were. As a previous guest has written, the buzzer rang each time someone arrived back, there were telephones ringing, then the hallway/lobby conversations etc. It was noisy, especially when the room occupants across the hall returned late in the evenings. True, we had a room with a garden view but with the doors open for a bit of fresh air, the place was overtaken with hungry mosquitoes that kept us awake and bitten all night. I read the review about the wet shower, and the picture has to be the one we had. We didn't even realize that it was operational, but the toilet seat was badly cracked from water. The towels were lovely and clean, but didn't absorb much. We ended up trying to sponge bath with the sink and that was awkward in such a confined space. Service from the desk and the breakfast bar was good, but I would definitely never want to return. Nor would I recommend this hotel. It was full we were told, so we didn't have any choice or a chance to see any other rooms. Upstairs/back rooms may be quieter away from the desk and they may have proper shower facilities. Busing to the centre seemed to work out well. Traveller beware of half truths.
