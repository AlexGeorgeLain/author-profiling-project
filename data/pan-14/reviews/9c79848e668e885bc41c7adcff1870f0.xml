We had one of the largest rooms in the hotel for our family of four and were very happy with it except for the floors which creaked so loudly it was impossible to tip toe around once the children were asleep. The bathroom was lovely. The public spaces are grand.It is located walking distance to the Duomo and shopping. The breakfast was wonderful. The restaurant was fully booked for dinner while we were there so it must be good. The staff were friendly but busy. The hotel seemed to be flooded with Americans. A good value for the price.
