Breakfast good and plentiful. Reception staff were very helpful especially booking tables at nice restaurants. I recommend eating at a restaurant called 'les quinze nuits' because it was really good value and food was very nice. Try the squid ink rice, looks horrible, but extremely tasty!!!! Taxi drivers in Barcelona are quite honest compared to other destinations. Overall Barcelona is beautiful and hotel was excellent. Highly Recommended!!!!
