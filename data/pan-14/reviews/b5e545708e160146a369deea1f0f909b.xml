I had requested a room closeby the elevator, and not only was it ideally located, the room I was placed in was wonderful. I had a corner room with two balconies and an amazing view of the beautiful waterfront and Mt. Rainier in the distance.The room was clean and comfortable. I ordered room service a couple of times and the orders arrived promptly. The Marriott employees were all pleasant and helpful to talk with. As for location - it couldn't be better. The waterfront restaurants and stores were all within walking distance. The double decker bus was located right across the street and stopped by twice an hour. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to go up to Pike Market through the elevator connected to the Marriott, but that alone was handy. And if you were to walk to the Space Needle, it would be a leisurely 20-25 min. walk or a quick 5 min. taxi ride (approx. $6).My stay at the Marriott was for 3 nights, 4 days and although I was there for business, it definitely felt like a quick vacation. Should I have the opportuntiy to come back again, I would love to stay at this particular hotel purely for its convenience and lovely experience.
