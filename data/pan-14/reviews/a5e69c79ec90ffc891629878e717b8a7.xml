And they are...but perfect as a place to rest your head and allow you to spend $ elsewhere. The property is clean and as a solo traveler I felt safe in the neighborhood. Easy walk from Victoria or Pimlico station...Pimlico a much calmer experience. Breakfasts were filling and tasty. Great access to bus, tube, grocery and restaurants. I would stay here again.
