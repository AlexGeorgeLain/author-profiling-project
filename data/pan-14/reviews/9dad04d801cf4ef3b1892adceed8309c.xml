The area looks vacant but I was able to walk around the area at night and still feel safe. You just have to know where you are going. Walking to the convention center, Pike Place Market was about 15-20 minutes. Very nice walk with lots of restaurants and shops along the way.Busline is nearby and free until 7pm, otherwise $1.25. Loved the wi-fi access.Room was decent. Bed was firm, what I prefer.Refrigerator and microwave were great for leftovers. Again, staff was able to provide utensils for my late-night eatings. Thanks. Complimentary breakfast was awesome. Always on time and a good variety too choose from.Would stay here again.
