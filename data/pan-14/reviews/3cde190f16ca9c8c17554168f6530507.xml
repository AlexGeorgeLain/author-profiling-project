The lounge is wonderful, with Glenlivet and other high end liquor on tap, and tasty snacks. The remodeled rooms featured plasma screens, and electric everything. Overall just beautifully appointed, and not too expensive by Tokyo standards. The staff is wonderful, too.The hotel is maybe a quarter mile from a subway intersection, but the walk is long if the weather isn't cooperating. It's not walking distance to anywhere else, really, although there are some nice restaurants within a couple of blocks.Bottom line: a five-star hotel, a three-star location
