We originally booked on the strength of the previous reviews and the very reasonable price we got (including parking), not to mention the great location a stone's throw from Union Square, the trolley stop and loads of shopping. We were not disappointed.The hotel itself is attractive, clean and recently renovated. Our room was on the small side, but this wasn't a problem - it was well appointed and had a very comfortable bed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the little bar in the lobby was great to grab a quick night cap after a long day out! The free popcorn and freshly baked cookies were also a nice touch.All in all, a gem of a hotel and definitely recommended.
