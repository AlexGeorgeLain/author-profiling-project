The staff was helpful with all of our requests. Breakfast in the mornings overlooking the rice paddies was excellent. Our package included breakfast, airport transfers, massages, limo to Ubud, free minibar/alcohol. This property was on par with the Amandari where we had drinks one night but much, much less in price.
