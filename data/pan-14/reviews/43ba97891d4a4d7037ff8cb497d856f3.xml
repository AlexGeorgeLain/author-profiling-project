This is an OK place, not great. The rooms are small. I mean european small. No evening turn down service or fresh towels. The front desk is quite helpful and the location is good. There is nowhere to eat in the motel and you have to walk to the Sheraton or Hilton to find a place in the evening. Only one doorman who was getting kind of stressed with a bunch of people leaving on Sunday morning. The most obvious thing I would suggest is turn down the lobby music. When we checked in it was playing classic rock so loud that we could not hear the guy at the desk. If you get a good price it is ok to stay here but at the full price I am really kind of luke warm about the International House.
