Last Feb. we stayed one night prior to our cruise whichwas leaving from San Juan. We loved the hotel then and decided to return this year - same time of year and for just one night prior to a cruise.My only regret is that it couldn't have been longer.The hotel is right on the ocean - walk out the door and thebeach is right there. The pool area is very nice as well.We had a wonderful room with a balcony facing the ocean.We had a great dinner at the hotel, listened to some livelySalsa music and a great girl singer in the lobby, visited theCasino and didn't have to leave the property - everything wewanted was right there.The accomodations were nicely decorated and very clean.The Staff is friendly and helpfulNext time we are in San Juan, we will arrange to stay at thishotel for a week - - one night is not enough.
