The last time we were there, about 10 years ago, we stayed at The Asia Center and decided to stay there again after a good experience. We spent three nights there this time before heading to the west coast. It has more rooms now and we stayed in the new section. We had a room with a double bed and it was fine. Yes, small by U.S. standards but what I've come to expect in lower cost hotels in Japan.The staff were great and most helpful. The front desk folks were good at speaking English though my wife is Japanese and that certainly helped. The place is clean and the halls only had a slight smell of smoke which didn't bother either of us. We found the breakfast most convient and reasonable considering we were in a pricey area of Tokyo. The area is great and the subway most convenient. One item to note is that many subways do not have escalators or elevators so travelers that tend to pack heavy, like us, will lug big suitcases up a lot of steps if arriving/departing from the hotel by the subway as we do. My suggestion is to resist the urge to pack heavy and take advantage of the washers and dryers at the hotel. Your back will thank you for a lighter suitcase!Not much else to say except this is now our hotel of choice in Tokyo. We aren't budget travellers per se but do recognize a good deal and this is one of them. Since all we do is basically sleep in the hotel the money we save is better spent on excellent sushi/sashimi, sake and shopping.
