I was in London recently on a 2 day business trip and decided to try out the Apex based on the Tripadvisor rankings. The location was very accessible to the Tower Hill tube station and is walking distance to both the Thames near the Tower Bridge as well as the London Financial district. The check in and check out was prompt and professional. I went up to my room and was really surprised at how updated, clean, and well-kept the room was. The room was decorated in a more modern style, had a king size bed,as well as a small couch. There seemed to be a real attention-to-detail given to the room, everything was crisp and there were no signs of wear-and-tear of any sort. Small touch, but I appreciated that the shampoo, conditioner, and hand lotion were in slightly larger bottles than hotels usually provide. Also loved the Apex-branded rubber ducky that they provide in the bathroom as a courtesy.Overall the experience was a really positive one--I look forward to returning in the future. The only shortcoming, if I had to be picky, is the hotel bar if you're looking to meet up with friends or colleagues. The hotel is located on a side-street that doesn't seem to be well known by the Londoners that I spoke with, and the hotel bar and lobby area doesn't necessarily have a huge wow factor. The night I was there we decided to go to the nearby Gouman Tower hotel bar (walking distance) for after-dinner drinks that includes a wonderful panoramic view of the Tower Bridge all lit up at night.
