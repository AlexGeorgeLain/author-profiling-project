Literally 5 mins ( I timed it) from Placa Catalunya, and the Aerobus terminal outside El Corte Ingles. Good sized room at rear - nice and quiet . Good sized bathroom and plenty of storage space, all spotlessly clean. Breakfast is an extensive cold buffet and dinner is based on a daily menu and a rather limited seasonal menu. We had dinner twice and found it to be excellent.Breakfast is 7 to 11 a.m. -very civilised ! ! .as is the 12 noon checkout. There is secure luggage storage for late departures. All the staff were friendly and helpful from reception to porters. We would definitely use the Mont blanc again.
