Visited for the Red Sox series with wife and two teenagers. I had forgotten how small a queen bed really is, and they aren't that comfortable compared to hotels that cost 2x as much :). The shuttle service to the games isn't run by the hotel, is services several hotels in the area; the time we used it they didn't have enough shuttles to get everyone back to the game in one pass so we waited awhile for them to cycle back and forth. That was $5/person roundtrip and taxi was about $12 one way for 4 people, but it can be equally hard to find a taxi after a big game.
