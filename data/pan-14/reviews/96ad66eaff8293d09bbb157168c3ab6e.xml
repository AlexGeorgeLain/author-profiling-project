The location was the best in Manhattan - close to theater, shopping many tourist sights, but off 7th Ave so the rooms are quiet. We were on the 3rd floor seldom heard any traffic noise.The room was well-sized and comfortable while the hotel lobby lounge were beautiful and luxurious.For the most part during our stay, the weather was warmer than we expected and we appreciated having full control of the air conditioner in the room. It was automatic, similar to central air conditioning units in our home in Texas, so it cycled on and off to maintain the desired temperature.And the tub! I'm normally a shower person, but couldn't resist taking some long soaks in the HUGE tub. What a way to relax from a long day of sightseeing!I loved this hotel will stay here again when I next visit NYC.
