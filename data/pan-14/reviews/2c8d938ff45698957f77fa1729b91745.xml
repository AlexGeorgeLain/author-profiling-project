Was able to see the Statue of Liberty, the Hudson River and the Empire State Building.The room was big, had 4 windows and the bed was great.The hotel is located one block from times square and you can take nearly every subway that runs through manhattan, because they all stop half a block away from the Westin.Staff was very efficient never had to wait to talk to somebody.This hotel is now my first choice when it is affordable. Last time i stayed at the Intercontinental, which i also liked, but the Westin is far superior and has a much better location.There is nothing to complain about this hotel.

Large bathroom with two sinks and the room itself had a small kitchen area.The bed was the best i have ever slept in.Everything is new and very trendy.There was nothing to complain about.Will definitely return!
