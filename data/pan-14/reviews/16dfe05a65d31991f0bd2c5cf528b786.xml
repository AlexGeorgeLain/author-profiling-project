The rest of the hotel, though, seemed a bit neglected -- in need of a bit of sprucing up--we had been in the hotel last year (not to stay but to eat at the adjoining restaurant-- which is a gem--The Millenium--a vegetarian restaurant)--and the place seemed to have gone downhill a bit since then. On the other hand, the price was right and the room was good. Management needs to take the plywood off the elevator door and fix it up--it really looks bad.
