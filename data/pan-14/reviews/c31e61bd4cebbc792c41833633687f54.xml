Rooms are clean, location is perfect!!When we go back to Paris, we will certainly consider it again!Minor thing to be mentioned.. the breakfast is quite expensive.. that's why we booked without.. There is a small supermarket and some bakeries nearby, from where you can make a solid and tasty breakfast yourself, for a quarter of the price of the hotel breakfast.Hotel is close to subway station (line 12) and to St. Placide (line 4)
