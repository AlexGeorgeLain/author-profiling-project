The entire stay was wonderful. The staff members are extremely friendly, courteous, efficient, and very fluent in English. The concierge desk could not have been more accomodating, even when we needed use of an adaptor for our computer at midnight one night. The location next to the river could not have been better. It is less than a twenty minute walk to a number of sites, including the train station, Piazza Santa Maria Novella, Ponte Vecchio, and the Uffizi Gallery. There are also a number of fabulous nearby restaurants and a wine bar just around the corner that comes alive each night at 10:00 p.m. The rooms are plush with old world furniture, window treatments, and artwork. The bathroom was roomy and up to date. There was also a work desk to conduct a little business each day, and hi-speed internet access for a fee. This is a great place to stay if price is of little concern and you want a pampered experience from beginning to end. We would not hesitate to stay again if we are ever in the Tuscany area in the future.
