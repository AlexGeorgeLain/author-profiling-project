We returned to this hotel in January so we must have been satisfied! If you want 4/5 star accommodation then go to a 4/5 star place. This hotel does not pretend to be that kind of place but offers everything the discerning traveller needs at a very acceptable price. The rooms are perfectly clean and comfortable with en suite shower and toilet. The breakfast room though small is adequate. The free internet and free local phone calls are a bonus. The fact that you have to use the ferry to reach Sydney Central Business District at AU$3.30 a trip (if you buy a Harbour Ten ticket) is frankly a bit of a bonus for the sheer pleasure of commuting on Sydney's iconic harbour ferry across the most beautiful harbour in the world. The ferry landing is less than 5 minutes walk away and the trip takes only 5-10 minutes direct to Circular Quay. It offers a pleasant stay in a North Sydney Harbour side Suburb away from the hustle and bustle - but near enough. Lovely walk round Mosman Bay and the Cremorne Reserve. Would recommend this inextravagant hotel to anyone
