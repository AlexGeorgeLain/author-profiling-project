I think it was a great value for the money. Yes, the food is overpiriced at the hotel; we had prepared ourselves for this before we went. But we went out explored local restaurants (also pricey). Beach was nice. Hotel provides clean towel everyday if needed. We booked outings everyday through the hotel were very satisfied w/ this. On one outing, the concierge had forgotten to confirm our reservations w/ the company the hotel called the company which held the catamaran up paid a taxi to get us there. We would stay there again, no probelm. The staff was friendly the hotel was clean.
