Called at 10 pm and asked if we wanted any.Oct. 30 Called concierge and asked for a cab van for six people at a specific time. Called at 7:00 for 8:30 pm. It was a woman. Got to concierge at appointment time and a man told us to go see the bell boy in the street, Luckily we only had five and squeezed into a cab, and made our dinner reservation with only 5 min, to spare.Parking charges, internet charges, room service charges are unconscionably large.Telephone is nearly inaudible to other inside hotel numbers both from the room and from the house phone across from the desk in the lobby. Strong hum indicates wiring problems with the phone system.Reservation was screwed up and we were given an invoice, and it was charged to Visa, after the first night of a four night reservation. Called early in the morning after the invoice was put under the door, and changed the incorrect reservation. Desk called back a second time hours later confused over the reservation.Sound isolation from very, very loud bass in the lobby practically shook the room. Called at 9:40 pm and complained but was told nicely that it would be over at 10 pm, which seemed reasonable.Room was ready early.
