The location is definitely the highlight of this hotel. I requested a room with a front facing view and thats what I got. I was slightly disappointed with the size and decor of the room compared to other Sofitels I've stayed in. We got a free drinks voucher which was a nice touch and they also left a little teddy on the bed. The staff were friendly albeit a sarcastic man at reception who made a bit of a song and dance over our reservation.Overall this was a nice hotel but not really in 4 star league imo. I would recommend staying if you get a good value rate as the location is excellent.
