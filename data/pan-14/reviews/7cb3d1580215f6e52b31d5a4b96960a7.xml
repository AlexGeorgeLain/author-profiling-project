The staff at the hotel tried their very best to see that everything that they providied was done well. I was travelling with two teenage daughters as well as my girlfriend so I wanted them to learn how to tip. We made sure that everone that gave us good service received at least a dollar for their trouble and we soon found that after only one day everyone knew our names and were very attentive to our every need or request. Mind you that I think we only tipped maybe $10 dollars through the day but you could tell that it was much appreciated. Our room was kept very clean and the maids even made towel art and placed flower petals around the room everyday. They kept my fridge stocked with exactly what we asked for everyday as well. The resturants were nice and the food plentiful so when I read other reviews saying the food was bad I have to believe that the folks are being a little picky. This resort is huge and unless you like to walk around alot I recommend you take the little trains that travel thru out the resort. You will not be unhappy staying at this resort.
