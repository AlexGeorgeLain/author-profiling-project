It is a small, family run hotel that has the feel of a bed and breakfast. It is very clean, the owners are friendly and helpful, and the location is great--our cab driver said it was the best area of Amsterdam. It is near the concert hall and several museums, and the more touristy areas are accessible by tram just 2 blocks from the hotel. Breakfast is served in a bright area overlooking a small garden, and the owners prepare hot food to order, as well as an array of cereals, fruit rolls and muffins. It was a great experience, and I highly recommend the hotel.
