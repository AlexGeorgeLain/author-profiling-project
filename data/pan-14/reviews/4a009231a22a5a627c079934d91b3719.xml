I emailed Keio Plaza directly and is pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel offers a rate slightly cheaper than what my tour agent quoted. It is about SGD350 per night for 7 nights ( 1 double, 1 single bed ). A bit pricely but it is situated in a very decent neighbourhood, west of Shinjuku station. Neighbourhood gets quiet after office hours.It is opposite Tokyo Met, so we went over twice for free city views at the Met's top floor. Awesome!Our room is huge and chamber service impeccable. The free internet connection in the room kept me connected to home.Keio Plaza has easy access to Shinjuku station via underground tunnel ( with travelator in the direction to the hotel during office hours ). There is also free shuttle services to Disneyland Tokyo ( to and fro ). We booked the hotel-Narita airport shuttle at the concierge to avoid dragging the luggages to Shinjuku Station.
