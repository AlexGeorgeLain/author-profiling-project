I noted stains on a hard backed chair, and stains on the blue decoration pillows on the beds. Vacuuming had not done properly as there was a line of dust all along the edge of the carpet in front of the wardrobe.The room and bathroom were a little shabby, but nothing a coat of paint could not fix. There was plenty of shampoo , hand soaps and also toothbrushes , which not many hotels provide. Sheets and towels were changed every day.The location for us was most inconvenient, but with such cheap taxis, it was not a problem to hop into one whenever we wanted to go anywhere. I cannot agree that it is a 5 minute walk to the night life of Clarke Quay - it is a lot further than 5 minutes walk away. I don't think I would stay here again, but mainly because of the location. .

It has a very lavish Reception area and the staff are very good . The rooms are tiny considering the price you have to pay, and the beds are like concrete. Fortunately there were many pillows, and to ensure I had a reasonable sleep, I actually slept on the pillows!The bathroom was OK, but looked somewhat tired. No special touches like orchids in the bathroom that we have previously had in cheaper hotels. We would not stay here again. You do not get good value for the price you pay.
