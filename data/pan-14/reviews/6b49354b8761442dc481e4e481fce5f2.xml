Possible prostitution check-ins might have taken place in lobby...not cool! But my biggest problem of all...was...the...BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You think they are part of the floor, but look closely, they are flat disgusting bugs!!!!! You kill them, and they reappear somehow! We ended up using our nasty towels provided by the hotel as a way to block bugs from crawling under the front door. Also, we had no view. The main window was near the ceiling. The air conditioning worked fine, but stunk. Overall, I did not look forward to coming back to the hotel at night. Although, you pretty much get what you pay for according to the rates in Singapore. I don't think I will be going back again, it's not worth it. I rather splurge and stay comfortably.
