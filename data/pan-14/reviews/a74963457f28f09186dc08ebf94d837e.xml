Delightful host Angela was helpful and welcoming, providing great information. Our twin room was HUGE with massive windows, comfortable beds and a great bathroom. Across the river from the main attractions, this is a great brisk 1/2 hour walk or a short bus trip from the Uffizi and other attractions. Our late train from Florence to Paris meant we checked out long before we needed to go, but Angela was very, very gracious in keeping our baggage and even in letting us come back and freshen up in the downstairs washroom before we headed out for the overnight trip. We would recommend this hotel highly! Great facilities, great location and wonderful staff.
