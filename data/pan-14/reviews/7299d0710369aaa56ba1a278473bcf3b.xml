We stayed at the Bavaro Princess and had a wonderful time. There were four of us, two teens and my husband and I. No one got sick. The food was very good for an all inclusive and our room was very nice. It was a little worn but clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and energetic. The beach and pool were beautiful. We will be back.
