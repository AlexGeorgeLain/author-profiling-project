This is a very good hotel with excellent sized rooms for any city centre, let alone Hong Kong. In particular I want to praise the staff, I only had to look at at staff member to get their attention and a positive response. Harbour view rooms are a must.The only people who may want to consider other options would be those who require an outside pool. The indoor pool was under refurbishment during my stay in August 2006. The hotel is 10 mins walk from the MTR (Metro) and the Star Ferry across to Hong Kong island. In my opion there is no reason for a tourist to prefer a Hong Kong rather than Kowloon 'side' hotel.The buffet restaurant serves a good breakfast and excellent evening meal. It copes very well with with a mix of locals, tour groups and individuals from a wide range of races and nationalities. Don't forget to book for the evening meal - it does get full. The lounge and Tapas bar provide good alternatives at reasonable to high prices. The Japanese and Chinese restaurants are too expensive and much too pretentious, there are better options within walking distance of the hotel.
