The hotel is not only very beautiful but the employees were friendly, helpful and made us feel very comfortable during our stay. The rooms were very nicely decorated with extra pillows on the bed and an oversheet on the blankets. The mattress had a comfy cover and we slept like babies. We visited the hotel gym/pool and spa and were very impressed. The indoor pool had large windows and skylights and was extremely clean. The jacuzzi was also large and very clean. The equipment in the gym was top of the line, varied and nicely laid out with televison viewing. Massage was available. The locker room was equal to that of a memebership gym. They had a steam room and showers and attendants checking it often. We ate at Connollys Pub and had great food and drinks at a reasonable price. You can even take a catwalk from the hotel to the airport for convenience or use their shuttle. The walk for us was a little far considering where our airline was located. We would definately return and plan to do so in the next week.
