It was full so we were booked at the Doubletree. My sister and I got a double room that had a large lanais and double beds. The room was very clean and the beds were exceptionally comfortable. My daughter-in-law said our beds were much more comfortable that theirs at the Hale Koa. We got a rental car in the lobby and spent our time exploring the island. We would stay at the Doubletree again for the comfort and price.
