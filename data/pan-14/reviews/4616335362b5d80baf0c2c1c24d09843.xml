The check in staff was very warm and friendly, actually all of the staff was very accommodating during our stay. We checked into our second floor room with the wonderful view of the mechanized parking garage(lol). The room was very clean and spacious, you could tell the Aqua company had done some room remodeling since taking over but there is still a little room for improvement. The beds are comfy and nothing beats the cool Hawaiian breeze coming in through your sliding glass door. The hotel is a quick walk to the beach and to many hot spots and eateries. I recommend the St. Germain bakery next to the hotel for breakfast, they have a wonderful assortment of freshly made pastries. My only real gripe is the parking or lack there of, if you are out past seven PM you are probably out of luck in the underground garage. The good news is that you can park at a hotel down the street and they will reimburse you. Yes, I am nitpicking but it is still annoying, Overall I had a great time at the Wave and would definitely stay there again.
