Even if we had paid full price, it would be worth it!The hotel is very close to the Central train station. There are shops, cafes, bars, and dining all nearby. The staff was very friendly and even moved our bags to a new room due to a booking mixup. The room was much larger other hotel rooms i've seen in Amsterdam. If you are used to standard rooms in the US with soap shampoo in the bath, and enough room to sit somewhere other than the bed, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.The bar was cozy, and the service was good. The restaurant looked nice, but we didn't come to AMS to spend the weekend in our hotel. I did not use the pool or sauna.

The rooms are trimmed in nice wood and are larger than most European Hotels. I actually had a king size bed, not 2 twins pushed together!The hotel is about 10km from the airport, which makes the time between shuttles long. The bus is small, but I had a car to return, so this was not an issue. The location is in a forest and away from everthing, except the trains which run behind the hotel. This is not a huge problem, since most airport hotels are noisy. The breakfast is pricey, but that's to be expected in a business hotel.Last word, If you have a rental car to return, this hotel is a great value and not too far away.
