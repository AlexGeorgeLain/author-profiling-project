I stayed in a standard double with my boyfriend for 3 nights in Oct 2008. The room itself was basic but comfortable however the main drawcard was the location.It's convenient enough to the main sights (5 min walk to metro or if you're energetic you can walk to the lourve) but also away from all the tourists so you feel like you're really in the heart of parisian life. One street over there are fantastic bakeries fruit markets for a cheap eat. Plus you can walk up the hill to Abbesses where there are some funky cafes shops. The room itself had a comfy bed, double glazed windows (we had no probs with noise), ensuite bathroom, tv. By no means luxurious... but very practical.We really enjoyed our stay I would totally recommend it.

The surrounding area is safe and quiet. Our triple room was clean and spacious. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. This is a great place to stay in Shinjuku.
