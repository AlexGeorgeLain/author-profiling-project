Although our room wasn't the largest it was exceptionally clean and quiet with a superb kitchenette area that had all the equipment you could need. The room occupied a corner on the 23rd floor and the view made up for it's size as you could look out with a clear view to the tree tops of Central Park and beyond. Considering we were in the middle of a vibrant city It was all very relaxing.The staff are friendly and obliging and we could not find any fault. The lack of an onsite restaurant is not an issue as the Viand Cafe next door opens at 6:30 and shuts late. It has an extensive menu and provides breakfasts that will set you up for the day. If you were of a lazy disposition you could eat here all week and not finish the menu.Be sure to go to the Fairway supermarket opposite, it's everything a food store should be.
