We were given a huge room with a view, Room 312. The bed was huge and a matress was just right for us. The bathroom has a twin sink, a large and deep bath tub and a separate room for toilet and bidet. Ammenities were lovely and they gave us new ones every day. The room was just under a private terrace so it was nice and quiet. We were so surprised to find a bottle of champagne waiting in the room. It was a special treat from the management to congratulate us for our 25th anniversary. Also, bottls of water were free and they replenish them every day. When we came back from sight seeing in the evening, we found two sleeping shirts waiting on the bed and the bed was turned in for the night with little cndies and a next day's forecast. This happened every evening. They have comfortable robes and slippers which we enjoyed.The breakfast room is just beautiful and food is very good.All the staff were very friendly and helpful.We highly recommend this hotel to anybody who plans a trip to Florence. We want to go back there just to stay at Degli Orafi.
