I had booked on the hotel website and I assumed from all the press and descriptions that the whole hotel had been renovated. Not so! The room that I had booked was apparently a Guestroom which meant that it was refurbished but the bathroom was not renovated. Also, though I booked a King room, they gave me a tiny room with a double bed. The website was very misleading (and I do extensive research before I commit to a booking). I would not have booked to stay at the Hilton if I had known that I wasn't getting one of the new rooms. Anyway, after several conversations with reception, they eventually put us in a renovated room, which I believe is the Deluxe room. If they had not done so, it would have been an extremely disappointing stay. The hotel itself is very minimalist (which I normally like) but it was quite cold in atmosphere. The lobby and cafe are not very inviting. The health club is pretty good - a big pool and spa and 2 saunas and 2 steam rooms. However, the whole atmosphere of the hotel did not feel 5-star. The best part of the stay was the buffet breakfast at the Glass Brasserie. Highlights were chef cooked-to-order omelettes, a juice bar, very good expresso coffees to order, a large variety of breads and pastries, the atmosphere and view.I would not stay here again but would consider returning for the breakfast!
