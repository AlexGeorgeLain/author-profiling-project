More or less this place was pretty icky.I just came back from staying there after going to our friends' wedding in Cambridge. There is nothing near the hotel (like a bar or diner or something) that we could walk to to entertain ourselves in between the wedding fun. We ended up taking taxi's everywhere which pretty much meant $10-$20 each way every time we went everywhere. There was an odor that kind of reminded me of that gross soap smell in public bathrooms pretty much everywhere we went. Mildewy stains in the rooms and bathrooms.IckWe didn't eat at that restaurant - something about a full American Breakfast at a Chinese restaurant in an icky hotel wasn't what we wanted!The upside was the staff was super nice and helpful. I will definitely not stay there again tho!
