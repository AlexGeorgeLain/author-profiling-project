It is very clean and has a decent continental breakfast that includes hard boiled eggs, fruit, croissants, juice and coffee. (No cappacinno, meats or cheeses). The staff is friendly and helpful. The room is large, the tub/shower has no barrier - so be sure to direct the shower head towards the tub wall. The closet has limited space for hanging clothes (less than 2 feet). It was great having free internet access (2 computers available for use). Only complaint would be a weak A/C that didn't do a very good job in keeping the room cool - but this seemed to be the norm for Italy.
