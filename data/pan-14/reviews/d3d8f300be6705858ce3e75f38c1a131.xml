The place was easily accessible by the city metro system (with only one transfer) from the airport. Arrival was a breeze and the woman spoke fluent German and English. The hotel itself was historic yet lovely and the STAFF is what will keep me coming back there EVERY time I visit Frankfurt. They were SO WELCOMING and friendly. The gym (at an adjacent real gym) was great and first rate. The front desk gives you a pass AND a workout bag that has shower slippers AND bottled water for free! They have nightly cocktails (again free) and direct you on great restaurants and things to see. Don't miss the Goethe house and museum and the opera house. I opted out of the champagne brunch and had coffee in the sunroom. Awesome place!
