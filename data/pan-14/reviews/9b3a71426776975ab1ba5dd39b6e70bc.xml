But the hotel staff was happy to take our luggage to our room.Rooms were musty and smelled of smoke - despite the non-smoking preference. Also was bothered by the lack of insulation from the ouside street. Make sure you bring eaplugs. Rooms were small, but adequate.Staff was very helpful and assisted with luggage on both arrival and departure.
