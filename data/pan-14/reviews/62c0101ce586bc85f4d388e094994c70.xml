The hotel stank of durian, the room was a dark cell, there were pile drivers operating next door. When I said that the room was not suitable the desk clerk said bad luck we will charge you anyway - and they did when I moved out. AVOID AT ALL COST - there are many reasonable hotels in this area of China Town - ALL better than the Keong Saik !!!!!!!!!

A better choice but the rooms are small, the aircon did not work and the room was not very clean. There are better choices in the area
