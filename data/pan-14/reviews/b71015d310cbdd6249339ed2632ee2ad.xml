It's everything that's been written about it. Absolutely perfect location; rooms spotlessly clean, bathroom in a different league from other hotels and beds totally comfortable. Staff beautiful and very helpful -they extended our check out time until late afternoon because we had a late night flight.However...not sure the separate sitting rooms work very well, particularly on the lower floors. They are rather gloomy because of the neighbouring building across the narrow, interesting (and almost traffic-free) street. Didn't feel comfortable in ours -despite the hammock! Higher up or a suite would probably be a better bet. Also with the dark red and black colour schemes it can feel a little claustrophobic. Maybe it was just the unusual weather - it rained for a lot of the time but you tended to lose touch with the outside world. The remedy would be to take regular trips to the 6th floor outdoor terrace which gave a tremendous view.But all in all as close to the perfect combination of style and service as is likely to be found. Just book a room above the second floor.......
