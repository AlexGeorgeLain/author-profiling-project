I have stayed in several other (more expensive) French Quarter properties, but have opted our last few trips to stay at the Hotel Provincial. The concierge is fantastic and helpful, not to mention, he has been there forever... I enjoy seeing a familiar face, who always recognizes us and makes us feel welcome. I love the quaint hotel bar, where my husband and I like to hang out and people watch. I love the convenience of Hotel Provincial most of all.. Close to the Cafe du Monde, The French Market, and Jackson Square.Some of the rooms are small, but very clean and nice. (We don't spend much time in our room, except to sleep anyway!) We always enjoy the fabulous courtyards and pool. True New Orleans charm!! A great hotel! I have always been very happy with this choice, we always recommend and always return....
