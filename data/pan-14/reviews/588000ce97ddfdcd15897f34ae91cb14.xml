Great place to stay while exploring NYC. Easy to get anywhere in Manhattan from there. Breakfast was OK, but they kept running out of food, and what there was had a definite freeze-dried quality. Other than the breakfast, the place was great, well maintained secure. I'd definitely stay there again, but eat out for breakfast.
