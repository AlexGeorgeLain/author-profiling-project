Although I don't play golf, I enjoyed the view over the golf course to the mountains. Both the grounds and the rooms were in excellent condition. The employees were friendly whenever I saw them and they were helpful when I had a question. I had several meals in the restaurant with friends and everyone praised the food. The location was convenient to the airport, freeways, and shopping. There is a major grocery store nearby to stock up the kitchen--which is complete with full-size appliances including a dishwasher and a clothes washer/dryer. I highly recommend the Legacy Golf Resort for an enjoyable stay in Phoenix.
