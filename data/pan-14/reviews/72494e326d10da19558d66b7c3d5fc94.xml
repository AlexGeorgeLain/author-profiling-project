The pool was the highlight for me, big enough for lap swimming! on a rooftop, with a view to the bay. The OMNI is close by ( couple block walk) hop on that for free, get off at Freedom Tower Station and you're only a couple blocks from the Bayside Marketplace. Lovely hotel room with a great view of Biscayne Bay, nice living room, separate bedroom area...very nice.
