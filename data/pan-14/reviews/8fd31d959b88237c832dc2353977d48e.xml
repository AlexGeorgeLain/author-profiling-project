Shade and ocean breeze, with all inclusive drinks that you can either pick up yourself or wait to be delivered right to the beach to you.This was our third trip to Punta Cana, and second time at the RIU Palace Macao. Hotel is showing some signs of aging, but food and service are still excellent. If you can't find what you like, you may have deeper problems... :-)Suites are really nice, but not sure if it's worth the money - no special service in the suites, just more space, living room, two balconies, two crappy TVs and same all inclusive mini-fridge and bar with vodka, gin, rum and brandy.Pool looked decent, but we didn't go to the pool at all - as mentioned, while on the most beautiful beach in the world, it would be a sin to pool it...Entertainment is so-so but with appropriate amount of pina coladas, caribbean orange, etc. it's still better than watching TV...All in all, perfect to relax and enjoy...
