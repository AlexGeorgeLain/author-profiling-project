The staff were next to none.Big shout out to Richard and Angel. Richard went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and took care of us. Thank you Richard. Our room was beautiful, to our maid Johanna Solano, thank you for taking such good care of us and teaching us some Spanish, and trying to learn English from us. You are a doll.This resort is huge and every inch is beautiful.We recommend the Marinarium snorkeling cruise, the crew is so much fun, and know their business, lots of interesting facts about marine life and the waters of Punta Cana. Quiet and interesting on the way out, fun dancing party on the way back. Thanks again to the best staff, best resort.
