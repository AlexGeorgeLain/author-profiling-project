Everyone was warm, helpful and professional. The rooms are spacious and comfortable I did not hear anything from my neighbors in the week I was here. To previous postings, yes, you do get road noise (some honking, braking, etc), but hey, this is a city, so that goes with the territory. The bed was very comfortable. For us, Nob Hill was close enough to Convention center, restaurants and shopping, but far enough away from the more crowded streets below. A special thanks to Robert the Concierge and the housekeeping staff. The breakfast buffet is very good, albeit expensive. The only complaint is that the fitness facility is small, dark and has limited equipment. The pool, however, is very nice.
