My package deal included the round-trip non-stop flight to Puerto-Rico and the seven night stay at Coral By The sea and for the price I paid, the hotel was okay! The staff treated me well and kept my room extremely clean and well stocked at all times.If you love the beach and also enjoy have many assorted choices of restaurants to eat in,Isla Verde is the place,Plus they have a supermarket not too far from the hotel and a good walk for those who enjoy exercising .The Bus stops near the hotel as well and for 75 cents per trip, you can be in old san juan in a heartbeat but don't expect to find any kind of nightlife at all in Isla Verde ,it don't exist! I judged this hotel differently because I'm a frequent visitorto the Caribbean and South America and many of their hotels cost twice as much and in worse condition,So I guess the enjoyment one can get by staying at Coral by the sea is in the eyes of the beholder.Whatever you do enjoy yourself and remember You are on Vacation!(smile)
