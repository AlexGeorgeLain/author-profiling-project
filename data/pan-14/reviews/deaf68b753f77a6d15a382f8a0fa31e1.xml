We came back with 2 sets of friends on June 6, 2007. We loved the decor, the location, and the separate sitting room. The staff is wonderfully helpful. They will make recommendations for restaurants, call cabs, give directions, etc. All their restaurant suggestions were wonderful. We love the mini cafeteria with food and beverages available all the time. Our friends were thrilled with this hotel, and they think we have wonderful taste!
