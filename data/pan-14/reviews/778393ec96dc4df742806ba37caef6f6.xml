I stayed at the Sofitel to break up a business trip and I couldn't have been more pleased with the change of pace that the Sofitel offered. The furnishings are refreshingly modern and my room was fantastic. It was extremely quiet with plenty of space. The beds are soft and perfect for sleeping in. The bathroom was fantastic with a glassed in shower and nice bathtub with provided robe. I never ever feel comfortable enough to take a bath in hotels - but didn't hesitate in this hotel. Wish I could have extended my stay here and is one of the few hotels in DC that I will continue to keep booking. Perfect location - within walking distance to the Old Ebbitt Grill for dinner and close enough for walking to the White House and the monuments. Also, my room ended up being the handicap accessible room and it had a doorbell and extra shower without a step-up.
