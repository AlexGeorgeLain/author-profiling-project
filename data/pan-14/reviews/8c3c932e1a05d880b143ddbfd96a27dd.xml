Our room was very clean, and the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and towels.The breakfast in the lounge was really good, with a great selection of bread and pastries, as well as delicious fresh fruit, and a range of teas and coffees.We enjoyed the informal drinks and nibbles in the lounge and met some lovely people over drinks there.The purpose of our trip was to meet up with our daughter and her husband who had flown over from their home in Seattle.I would recommend this hotel, and hope to return one day, but in the summer - it was bitterly cold for this trip!!
