My sister and I stayed at the NH City Centre for 2 nights in July 2005.If you're travelling from the Schipol airport to this hotel, be sure to take the Connexions shuttle bus service from outside the airport arrivals - 17.50euros for a return ticket and they drop you right outside the door to the hotel! You can book your return pick-up time at the Hotel reception.We arrived at the hotel at 11am so didn't expect a room to be ready, they did hold our luggage for us until 3pm though. Apparently all the hotel rooms differ in size so I can't directly compare our room, it was a fair size for the two of us for two nights, but I wouldn't want to stay for much longer in such a small room. However it was spotlessly clean, the beds were very comfy, nice modern decor, the shower was powerful and noise from other guests wasn't a major problem.The best feature of the hotel is the location - 10 mins from Dam Square and the Royal Palace, 3 mins from Flower Market, 10 mins from Leidseplein, 10 mins from Anne Frank's house (walking distances) - we didn't get a bus or tram anywhere because we were so central to everything.They definately need more reception staff at this hotel as whenever we needed to visit reception we had to wait 5/10 mins (even just to re-programme our room key as it wouldn't let us in).I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean, comfortable and affordable base to explore gorgeous Amsterdam!I will be back one day!
