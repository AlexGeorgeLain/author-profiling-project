The property is a good value but is dated somewhat, and the room we stayed in had a musky smoke oder to it, as though the room had been a smoking room at some point in the past. The free breakfast was alright, but if there is a long line, I would skip it. The staff was very helpful, and even let me check in before 12 noon, and gave me a choice of rooms on the property. If you are not into kids stay away from the rooms that are near the pool as it gets loud. There are several restaurants located close by just north on 44th St. (Moes, IHop, Grill Next Door (burger joint), Slotsky's Deli, etc)
