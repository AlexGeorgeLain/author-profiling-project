We spent our final two nights at the JK Place. When we arrived we were greeted warmly and offered something cool to drink. Our room was nice but very small. We often felt as though we were interupting the staff. There is no real bar and it was very difficult to get a cocktail in the evening. The hotel had a funny smell but our room did not. The feel of this is almost like a bed and breakfast. The mini bar was a nice touch but ours was not restocked during our visit. We had joined Small Luxury Hotels of the World Club and Leading Hotels of the World Club before we left (Highly recommend this). Our hotels were informed we were celebrating our 20th anniversary. When we arrived at our other hotels (Grand Hotel Miramare in Santa Margherita and Grand Hotel Continental in Siena) we were welcomed to wonderful rooms where fresh flowers, fruit, and chilled champage was waiting. There was a very small fruit plate at the JK Place.Overall we were very disappointed in this hotel. If you are looking for a funky, modern, SMALL feel hotel this place would be great. I wish we had picked somewhere else.
