The rooms are in need of renovation, wallpaper is pealing, bathrooms are old, but all was functional.Having paid $42 at priceline I figure it was a good deal- I wouldn't pay a lot more.The lobby and restaurant are all redone and the food was tasty. Staff was friendly and responsive.Driving to and from the Hotel is a little confusing, since it is right at the airport make sure you get your parking validated
