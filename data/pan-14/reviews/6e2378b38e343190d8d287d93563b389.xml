For $99, our expectations were definitely exceeded, and we would recommend this hotel to anyone!We arrived after 11 p.m., exhausted, and were pleasantly surprised to find out we'd been upgraded to a suite. The suite was huge and shaped like a rectangle. The separate sitting area, desk and old school TV were on one end, but that area was the farther from the window so rather dark. The restroom was in the middle of the suite, along with an empty fridge (no minibar but the sign said they could stock it for you) and a big mirror, good for getting ready while the husband was in the shower the next day. The king size bed was luxurious, and we appreciated the huge flat screen TV in that area of the room. We had a view of the airport and Burger King from our 6th floor room. One odd thing, the room had one bathrobe and one bottle of water, as if it was set up for one traveller even though we'd noted there were two of us on the reservation...but no big deal.The only slight drawback was speed of service in the lounge. We went down at 11:20 p.m. for a quick bite as we hadn't eaten since 4 p.m., and it took our food (an average club sandwich) 45 minutes to come. There were maybe eight people in the lounge so I'm not sure what the problem was, but the server apologized.Overall, for the incredible value we would definitely stay here again if we have to fly in/out of LAX. One nice perk, we are Marriott Silver Elite members and they recognized us with a coupon for a free latte in the morning. This was definitely one of the nicer Marriott brand hotels we've stayed in.
