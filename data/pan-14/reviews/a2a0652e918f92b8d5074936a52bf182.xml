It was pretty nice, but one of the bellmen was very rude for no reason (I expected it, but I was still a little mad), and the concerige also had a bit of an attitude. Overall the rooms were great (as big as I've ever stayed at..not small at all), the bathrooms were a little small and the water pressure in the showers sucked but it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. The hotel's great, especially the location, and I LOVE New York!!! Everyone should go!!

Ask for a room above the 30th floor, you won't be disappointed. I keep hearing complaints about construction, but I never heard a thing. It might have been because I was so high up, but I wouldn't be too concerned. Housekeeping comes by twice a day, and it's close to everything. About 200 steps away is the Chambers St. station, which takes you everywhere. Very safe, very secure. I'd recommend it to anyone.
