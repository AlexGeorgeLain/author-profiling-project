We own a timeshare in the Marriott system so we stayed cheap. When I booked, I could have paid the same price at the Doral across the street with kids eat free. We made the right choice for the extra room, and after seeing how bad the Doral Hotel's room are. The pool at the Villas is nice, and we went across the Doral's Pool twice because the kids liked the big slide there. The room was completely renovated and is just a little smaller than other Marriott Timeshares. Would suggest to anyone who has a family.
