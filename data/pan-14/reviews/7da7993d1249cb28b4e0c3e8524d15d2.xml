It more than fulfilled our expectations for a 3 star hotel in a perfect location. Check in was swift and pleasant, and the room was so cosy and we were on the top floor. The bathroom was lovely, and this like many other Paris rooms was small but that just added to our overall experience. We would return to this hotel in a heart beat. The breakfast was included in our nightly rate, but at 10 euros each I doubt we would have paid this amount for it had it not been included. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and always helpful with any questions we had.As a previous reviewer said a safe bet A great hotel :-))
