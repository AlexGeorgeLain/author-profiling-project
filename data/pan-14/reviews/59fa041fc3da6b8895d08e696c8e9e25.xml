For our 2-night stay the room was spacious, extremely clean and well maintained. We had a car (but didn't need it) and parking was secure and free. We didn't feel unsafe in the area. The hotel isn't in a no go zone. We walked down to Fisherman's Wharf and got the cable car back (don't recommend you do the reverse!). The hotel even got our money refunded for a tour we took that didn't work out as advertised. This we didn't expect. We would definitely stay at the Castle Inn again. We didn't have any problems whatsoever and everything we needed was provided.
