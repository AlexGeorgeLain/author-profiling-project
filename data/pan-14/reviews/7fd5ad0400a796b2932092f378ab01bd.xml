I had been correspnding via e-mail with one of the managers, and when we arrived, he introduced himself at check in. We love this place so much!! The new Shopping Center on Lewers is so convenient, just a few shorts steps away, has a variety of shops and restaurants. The design of the shopping center is is made to look like a giant wave. Waikiki is going through lots of contsruction and updates, but none of this interfered with our trip.
