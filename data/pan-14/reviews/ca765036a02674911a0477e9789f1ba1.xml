We went there to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary. Everything was great. The service was unbelievable especially in the restaurants. The staff was constantly clearing off the table and refilling the wine glasses. Everyone was very polite too.The food was very good and I am a very fussy eater. We ate in the breakfast buffet, the Italian buffet. the steakhouse and the seafood restaurantOur room was on the first floor facing the pool. It was roomy and had all the amenities you would expect. The bathrooms are not totally private but it didn't matter to us.The pool is so large that you have no problem finding a lounge.and plenty of room to swim without bumping into people. The beach also had enough lounges.We went on the ATV tour which we both enjoyed.I would highly recommend this hotel.
