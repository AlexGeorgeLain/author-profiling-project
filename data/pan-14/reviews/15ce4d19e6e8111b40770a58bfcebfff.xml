Room service was stellar in both selection and quality. Views are unbeatable, and the rooms are reasonably large and very nicely furnished. The complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby before the restaurant opens is very nice, as is the complementary internet access in the business center. I love the Ritz and the Four Seasons, but I will continue to choose the MO for the views...

		<document id="dbba96af9cf69f3030c555ffffadf3ca" url=""><![CDATA[Very Solid Perfect location in the very center of east berlin, minutes from shopping, restaurants, and attractions, and a subway station right across the street. Rooms are small by US standards, but very nicely fitted (at least the newly renovated deluxe rooms, which are the only rooms with the heavenly beds). Service was overall excellent, though the concierge staff was unimpressive. Fabulous breakfast with sparkling wine and an incredible selection of european cheeses.
