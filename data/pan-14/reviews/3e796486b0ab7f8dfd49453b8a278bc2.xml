The views from the room was amazing, the beds were absolute heaven with a ridicolous amount of cushions that you would never use but still happy they were there anyway.The cleaning of our room was done everyday and impeccable. The hotel pool is ok, but the gym equipment abit worn.The only downside i could pick was the reception desk, usually waiting half an hour at the min anytime you were there.
