It is two blocks from the Rjiksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. I walked all over the city from the hotel. The staff are very helpful, particularly Martina.The breakfast is so so. Also the hotel is located near the PC shops. If you go there, go to the PC Cafe. I'm still thinking about the sandwich I had.The rooms are SMALL!! But the bed was comfortable and it kept me out of my room since I was there to see the city anyway not lay in the lap of luxury. The free internet is also a nice feature.

The walls are paper thin and you can hear the train every two minutes beneath the hotel! The staff were nice but the hotel is a bit dark and dank for my taste. I should have stay in the Latin Quarter, wasn't crazy about Marais.
