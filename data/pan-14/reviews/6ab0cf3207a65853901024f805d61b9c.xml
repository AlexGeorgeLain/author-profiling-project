We managed to get sea facing deluxe room for 35 pounds a night including breakfast. Room was immaculate, my only gripe was that it was a bit damp at night. The Balinese staff we're the most genuinely friendly people I have ever come across, front the receptionist to the cleaner, always say hi, smiling, 7* service.Breakfast contained a huge variety of food, even chicken nuggets on one morning!!The beach, pool and gardens were spotless, the sea wasnt great for swimming but that was no bother as the pool was great. I recommend the water aerobics in the morning!!In the evenings we chose the themed buffets, first night tex-mex and the 2nd was mongolian, and the best thing about this one was you could have your own mie goreng made infront of your eyes with your choice of meat, veg and spices!Didn't get round to venturing outside so i can't comment on the rest of the resort. Same goes for the spa, didn't get round to checking it out.I do recommend getting a massage in the hut near the pool, was around 5pound for 1hrs full body massage.I could write an essay on this hotel and its high standards, warm welcome and great service, but i would be here all day! Would go back no hesitation. Loved it!
