If you are a budget traveller then this hotel is the place to be, you cannot expect 5-star suites. The hotel was neat, tidy and all you would need for a few nights in Honolulu. As you walked into the lobby you could see there were renovations in progress because there were often workmen there during daylight hours. Get in quick and book your accommodation before the prices for the room doubles when the renovations are complete.The staff were all helpful and responded to requests promptly. One day our shower was not draining properly and within 5 minutes there was a maintenance person up to our room and the issue was fixed quickly.Simple, cheap clean accommodation. I would not choose this hotel for a luxurious Honolulu getaway but for a few nights, particularly between island hops, it is suitable.
