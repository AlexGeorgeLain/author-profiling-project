First time -- even though I did not require or use them -- I have EVER had a dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer in a hotel room (in addition to fridge, microwave, etc.). The room itself was very tastefully decorated and comfortable. I was on the 28th floor and enjoyed a lovely view of the Toronto's bristling skyline.I am a 68-year-old bachelor and a bit fussy. If I had had a bathtub -- in combination with or in addition to -- the shower in the bathroom, I would have been in heaven. I happen to prefer a tub or tub-shower combination to a shower. But it was a very nice shower.This hotel was everything the reviews said it would be and perhaps a bit more. It is centrally located (I walked from the train station to the hotel which was only two or three blocks away) and right near a metro station and lots of places to shop and eat. Toronto has an extensive underground shopping and dining mall. One can enter it directly from the lobby of the hotel.There is a suana, exercise room and pool, but since my visit was so short (3 days), I did not use them (but I did check them out). There was also free internet service on three computers in the lobby.I only had one meal in the hotel (room service is available): breakfast in its lobby. It was a lovely buffet with hot and cold selections, but (for me) slightly overpriced at aproximately US$20. Especially, when one can step out of the door or go down to the underground mall and find something much cheaper.The staff was polite and helpful. And my room was as silent as tomb. I highly recommend this hotel.
