Room was large, clean and comfortable with a fantastic view from the very large window (sixth floor). Staff were friendly and most helpful and the breakfast was truly great - kept us going for most of the day. Although the location was quiet, it was within easy walking distance of museums, Leidesplein, trams and canal bus stop. Would definitely stay ther again.
