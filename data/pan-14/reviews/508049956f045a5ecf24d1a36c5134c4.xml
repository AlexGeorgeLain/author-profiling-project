I felt extremely safe and the subway (red and blue lines) is only about a 3 block walk away. The lodge itself could use some work. The bed was extremely hard. After a long day/night of walking the last thing you want is a hard bed. There was also a dingy smell to the place, but it was tolerable. We stayed on the first floor with a shared toilet. It was rarely otherwise occupied so that really wasn't an issue. The shower and sink worked well in the room. It got pretty warm outside one of the days we were there, and so, fairly warm in the room. I turned on the ceiling fan and was sprinkled with dust bunnies, which was kinda gross. There was not much closet space, and only about 4 hangers, so bring some extra if you plan on hanging up your clothes. The desk and dresser drawers were not the most appealing places to store your clothes, so we opted for keeping everything in our suitcases. There was a flat screen in the room, but some channels didn't come in very well. However, we rarley watched tv so this wasn't really a big issue. The walls are thin so you can hear whenever someone else talks. The only reasons this place is above average are b/c it is cheap for NYC, and has a safe, conveinent location. If you are used to chain hotels, this place may take a little getting used to, but it was worth the $$$ we saved to stay here.
