Everything about it was excellent and it certainly deserved a higher rating than three stars. Our superior double room was large, with a beautiful bathroom including a separate toilet. It overlooked the lovely small french street and it was great to watch the world go by. The double glazing was most effective. The reception and breakfast staff were most helpful and the small courtyard would have been a perfect place to sit had the weather been warmer. When we return to Paris, which I am sure we will, we will certainly go back to Hotel de Varenne.
