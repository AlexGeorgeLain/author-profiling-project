Booked for 19-22 although we were arriving from Korea on the 20th to ensure a room at 0700 on the 20th.Arrived and I had no room. They then said I could get a room but I'd have to move at noon. I thought this was unacceptable since I had paid for a room beginning the night before. I asked for an upgraded room if I had to move. I was then magically given a room. I figured it would be bottom of the barrel and I was right. It was in the Diamond tower which I think it one of the oldest. It was bare bones, but decent.The location, ammentities, and shops were great! I used the Mandara Spa, pool, and gym. Pricey, but nice.Checkout was insane. There were so many ppl standing there and the system was down. Not effecient at all.Would probably try this place again, not too sure.

If you want an economy hotel in the heart of Old San Juan within walking distance of the historic sites, numerous restaurants, shops, etc....this is it! Not a great hotel for kids though....not much for them to do and the kids TV channel was not working well.The room is small, and rather comfy. The bathroom is tiny. The main areas were not air conditioned except for the lobby. The room had A/C but only off or on! No temperature adjustment so it was either COLD, or HOT. I was sick so this created a problem for my chest cold. It is a bare bones, basic room. No frills here but it is clean and the maids are excellent! You may need to ask for washcloths (we had to).We only used the rooftop restaurant for the continental breakfast which consisted of toast, apples, bananas, juices, coffee, milk, cold cereal and some pastries. The view from the roof is not as beautiful as the pics on the site. There is a lot of construction going on and decrepit rooftops nearby.The streets and sidewalks are narrow and cobbled so wear sneakers....sandals may get you a twisted ankle. The area is very easy to navigate and the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the bus station to go to the other cities. We went to Condado beach. It was beautiful, clean, warm.....best part of the vacation. We went to El Morro, San Cristobal (forts), and the gardens of Casa Blanca. It was beautiful! Take sunscreen and water on these walks (within walking distance of the hotel)! Restaurants are plenty and very good! You must go to El Jibarito on Calle del Sol. Very tasty, inexpensive and local. We also tried Barrachina on Fortaleza St (same as Milano). Pricier but great food and service! Fri and Sat nights have a flamenco show there. See the Le Lo Lai show if you are there when it takes place. Ask the front desk cause this show travels and it is well worth it! Parrot Club Restaurant is also near Milano but it was a little more commercial, still good though. Cafe Puerto Rico is around the corner from Milano and has tasty appetizers.The wait for a bus can be 20-40 minutes but the rides are only 75 cents versus a $10-12 cab ride.Great location/convenience but if you want more style and ammentities, you may want to go elsewhere.
