Pool was beautiful but a shortage of places to lay by it without being burnt by the sun - not many sunbeds and very little shade except from the umbrellas which did not produce much shade in the morning. Staff were very helpful in moving the beds around for our winter white skin.The free shuttle bus to Ubud was useful for general shopping. We also hired, via the hotel, a car and driver for the day and had a wonderful time sightseeing at a very reasonable cost.We were there for the Balinese New year and the hotel organised a trip for us to join in the New Year's Eve procession which was great - if you can be in Bali at this time it is something not to be missed!

Suggest for better swimming ask for an odd number.Staff were wonderful, we ate in the hotel but also walked along the sea front to the adjacent hotels for some evening meals for a change. You can book it all to your room whichever hotel you decide has the food for you that evening. Very pleasant to walk along the sea front and nobody to hassle you as you choose which hotel and which restaurant. Pretty empty so no need to book in advance but if you do you seem to get special treatment!
