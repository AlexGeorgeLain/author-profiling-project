Our first impression upon checking in was not great. They were very busy and we waited for about ten minutes before we were acknowledged. We got a great price on the room for two nights, $240 EU inclusive of VAT. The room was OK, carpet a little worn, but everything else was great. New flat screen TV, beds that were not hard as a rock (atypical for Europe in our experience) and the service was outstanding. We had a couple of problems with the room and someone was at our door to correct things within 5 minutes of calling the front desk.The location is fantastic - it is directly across the street from the Barcelona Cathedral and within walking distance of Las Rambles and other sights. The food in the hotel's restaurant is excellent -a fixed price 3 course meal including wine and bottled water was 22 EU and the Catalonian cuisine was excellent. The front desk people were very helpful and referred us to a private 1/2 day tour that was perfect.All together it was a very good experience and we'd stay there again
