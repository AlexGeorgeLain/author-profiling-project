But the experience that the whole hotel gave us is quite relaxing and even feel pampered, from the check-in procedure, the patience that the front desk lady in answering my questions (or trying to find answers to my numerous questions) and even helping me book for dinner at the wonderful hotel restaurant, to showing us to our room, just like an honored guests in an old friend's house, is just superb! This is really a nice icing to cap a wonderful trip.Highly recommended.
