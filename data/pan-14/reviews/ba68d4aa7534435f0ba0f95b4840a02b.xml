About average for Sydney prices but well located on a wharf into the harbour and walking distance to the city.Warning. Check your bill; we were charged for breakfast and the use of the bar. After contacting the hotel they did refund the breakfast, but failed to credit the bar which we had not used.As a traveller with a daughter in the area we ate opposite for half the price at Charlies and purchased water there for $3. Be warned, check your account.
