The restaurant was open plan into the lobby and either the extractors in the kitchen were non existant or not being used. The lifts then smelt of the fat taking you up to the rooms. The corridors in the hotel were tatty and in need of redecoration. The toilet was blocked in our room. I called down to reception and it was fixed within 10 mins. Our first evening we went to the bar, which was empty - not surprising as it was besides the restaurant - that awful smell was lingering - we had one drink and left to visit the hotel next door (which was our first choice and was unfortunately full) it was beautiful beyond compare. Unless they do something about the kitchens don't bother going, drive right past!
