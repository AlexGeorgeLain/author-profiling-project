Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker, the staff were uber-helpful. Great location in front of a u-bahn stop.

The lobby was impressive, and always lively. The breakfast was more like one in Germany! Very generous. There is a lovely deck on the roof, with a bar and chaise lounges. Excellent location near shopping, Las Ramblas and the metro.The staff was very helpful as well, arranging for rental car, restaurant reservations and hotel reservations out of town. We would stay there alone in a heartbeat.
