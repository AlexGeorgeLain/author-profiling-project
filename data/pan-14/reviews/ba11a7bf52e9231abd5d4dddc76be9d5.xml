We came to San Francisco to listen to live music, and needed a place to crash after the concert. After parking next door at the Embarcadero #4 next door ($30.00 overnight, no in and out), we walked into and up to the lobby to check in. I believe the hotel valet parking is $54.00 overnight. We had our key in our hands within 8 minutes - very efficient. The room was on the 15th floor and although we were given a King with City View, we had a great view of the Transamerica Pyramid.The hotel is convenient to the Ferry Building, and we hit Hog Island for oysters and wine before going back to our room for a nap before our night out.Taxis are plentiful and we got to the SOMA venue quickly. After our post-club dinner at a late-night restaurant, our taxi quickly took us back. No ride was over $7.We checked out before 7am as we had work at 9am back in Sacramento.We like this hotel because of the convenience to shopping, eating, drinking, dancing, and all of downtown San Francisco.
