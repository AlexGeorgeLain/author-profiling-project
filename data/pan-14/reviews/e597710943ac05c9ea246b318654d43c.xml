What a mistake to pick this hotel! Our key card kept going bad, locking us out of our room, and had to be replaced 6x. The shower worked fitfully. Towels were sometimes nonexistent. The food in the beach buffet was pathetic: overcooked meat and fish, soggy vegetables and mushy pizza. Reservations had to be made in the a la carte restaurants, were often refused, and the restaurants were half-empty when you looked in. Food was mediocre, and we both got sick after dining in the Dominican restaurant. There were too few shade trees or shelters at the beach, and you had to get up at 6AM to reserve a chaise.The place was so huge, you needed to take one of 2 trolley trains to get anywhere, waiting in the heat and hoping they didn't break down. Overall we were happy to leave and will return to the Bavaro Palace from now on.
