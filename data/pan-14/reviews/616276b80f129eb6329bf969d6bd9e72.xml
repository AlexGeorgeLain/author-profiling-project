Centrally located on Kuhio Avenue, one can easily walk to shops, restaurants and of course the beach. The beach is only about 3-4 minutes by foot from the hotel and a nice little walk at that.Rooms are large and clean, with simple amenities. You can get kitchens if you want, which would be great for families. Views are limited, and since the building is built in an L shape, you get different views, depending on how high up you are: water, mountains, street, or other buildings.Staff are friendly and get things done efficiently. Right across the street is the Food Pantry, which is a supermarket with everything you need, including souveniers.There is a safe in the room, mini-fridge and other basics. Balconies are nice and big, great for relaxing on. There is a tiny weight room, and a large pool...but who wants to go to the pool in Hawaii??? They also have a shuttle which will take you to several points in the Waikiki area for free, you just need to show your room card. There is also parking at the hotel, but this tends to be on the expensive side, just as most other hotels are expensive for this.Again, great location for a basic room. If you are going to be in your room most of the time, I would not recommend this. But if you are there for the sun, surf and sights, then this is a good place to be. Enjoy!!
