We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The girl at check- in was very pleasant asked if we were there on holiday. When we said it was for our anniversary she looked to see if a suite was available upgraded us to one for no extra charge. The room was vast with facilities to make tea/coffee, lovely soaps etc in the bathroom wonderful fluffy bathrobes - heaven! The hotel was bright, clean airy the air-conditioning was up to date. The area is quiet but only a 5 minute walk to Faneuil Hall, Quincy market the harbour. We did the tram tour the Freedom trail during our visit. We ate breakfast just across the street in a small cafe where we could get omlette with bacon, home fries toast for less than $6. The food was freshly cooked if you didn't mind using plastic plates, knives forks it was great value. We found the people of Boston very friendly helpful throughly enjoyed our trip.
