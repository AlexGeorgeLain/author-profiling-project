A few days before we left for the resort we emailed Carolina Barragan Beck, a guest relations rep, to make dinner reservations. Because the resort was at capacity, she explained that each group could make reservations at 3 restaruants only. When we arrived we verified the reservations and, consequently, had no problem getting into the restaurants. Her email address is (---). Check in was quick and easy. Enjoy a rum punch while they process your reservation.BRING AN EXTENSION CORD! There is one standard US type plug BEHIND the TV and mini fridge center. It can be accessed by opening the lower doors of the center. This is the only spot to plug in US type hair driers and curling irons, etc.Our rooms exceeded expectations. We were in villa 62. Each had a king bed and a large jacuzzi tub within a pillared area of the room. Initially, 2 members of our party were placed in villa 14. Those rooms were standard hotel rooms and not nearly as nice as the jacuzzi villas. The reservation desk was more than willing to reassign them to villa 62. The mini fridge was well stocked. We left a note in the fridge asking for diet coke and received coke light (their version of diet coke) as requested for the rest of the stay. They also leave plenty of beer and water. Our only problem was that the housekeepers kept forgettng to give one room towels and soap! Language is not a problem here. The reservation desk, guest relations and other key staff have an excellent command of English. The rest of the staff know enough to get you what you need.The staff is amazing. They have a very strong work ethic and take considerable pride in their work. We never saw anyone slacking. They are extremely friendly and will be happy to talk to you about their country. Their warm smiles were a delight. Such an upbeat group of people! We honestly felt sorry for the maids who were assigned to maintain the bathrooms between the the wedding gazebo and the beach. These ladies stood in the heat all day cleaning up the sand and water that was tracked into the bathrooms by the vacationers....we could not imagine a more difficult job. . If you want to tip anyone, please be sure to find these ladies. They are very deserving.The food was awesome. There are an amazing array of choices and something for everyone. None of our group experienced any stomach upset. They warn you not to drink the water . There are plenty of sources of filtered and bottled water all around the resort.. Breakfast is served at one of several massive buffets. The only breakfast food we could not find was bagels! Lunch is served at multiple places around the resort. For dinner, there is the choice of the lovely restaurants or the buffets. Bars are everywhere. Hemingways is the classiest bar and a wonderful place to meet for a pre-dinner drink. We were at the resort for the New Years Eve Gala - what an event!The beach is very clean. It was extremely windy during our stay and the water was cool. We spent most of our time at the pool. Chairs are at a premium. Reserve yours early by placing a book or towel on it. It appeared that everyone honored this method of saving a chair.The gym is very small and warm. The roads within the resort are excellent if you want to jog. The Sports Center has plenty to do and the staff is a blast. The entire area of the total resort is huge. If you don't like to walk, this is not the place for you. We were not bothered by the few vendors on the beach. We did walk down to the vendor stores (go to the beach and turn right) and bought some pictures and jewerly. Absolutely do not pay asking price for anything. They will accept 1/2 to 1/3 of what they first quote you. We spent time talking to two of the vendors. Both were students at the University and shared their experiences with living and going to school in the DR. A couple of other vendors were more intense and made us a little uncomfortable. For safety reasons, I would not recommend going down here alone, especially if you are a woman. Guards are stationed at both ends of the resort beach.It was warm each day but we did have a fair amount of clouds. There is at least one massive downpour each day. You might want to bring an umbrella because not every walkway is covered.Book your trip now! This resort is absolutely worth the money we spent. You will not be disappointed!
