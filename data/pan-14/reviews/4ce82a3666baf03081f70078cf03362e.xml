We noticed that the price was considerably higher than when we were there before when it was the Holiday Inn. We were looking forward to seeing the renovations and they were very nice, however, it should not be financed on the backs of the customers. I was also appalled at the term - mandatory valet parking. At $18 per day, It should have been discussed when the reservation was made. Ok, our mistake. Now, on to the restaurant. Make sure to refinance your house before setting foot in there. A glass of wine is $17 and a very small appetizer (2 tiny eggrolls) is $16. My advice: Take a cab to Santa Monica. Believe me, it will save you tons of money. Overall, we won't be back- there are much nicer hotels for the same price or less in West LA.
