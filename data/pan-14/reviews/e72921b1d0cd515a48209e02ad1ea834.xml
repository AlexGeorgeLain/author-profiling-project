All the rooms have balconies with peek-a-boo views of the water - which half the Hyatt rooms do not!The property is an older 6 story building, but is kept in great condition and sparkling clean. The elevator goes to the fifth floor, if you have a 6th floor room, you have to go up one flight of stairs on foot.My room was advertised as a Very Small Room, it was small, with a queen size bed, but more than adequate for one person, even for two if you had only one small suitcase between you. The bathroom was, in comparison, quite spacious. There was a microwave and coffee maker in the room. Other, larger rooms have kitchenettes. I paid $61.54/night incl. tax, and enjoyed it enough to return for a second stay. Although housekeeping comes only every 4th day, fresh towels and beach towels are always available on demand at the front desk.There are a lot of cheap places to eat in the immediate area, and several mini marts if you want to get things to eat in your room. Robert's Shuttle leaves the airport every 20 minutes and will take you right to the hotel for $9. Another company, which you can book at the front desk, will pick you up for $8, but they come only once an hour.The young man at the front desk could not have been more helpful and accomodating. There are no phones in the room (there are TVs though) but you can use the phone at the front desk from 9am to 7pm.The only problem would by the street noise if you are a light sleeper. Although the side street is quiet, the noise from two major roads does filter through. The window are louvers, and so do not offer any sound insulation.
