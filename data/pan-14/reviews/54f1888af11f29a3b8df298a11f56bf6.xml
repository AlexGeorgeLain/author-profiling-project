The hotel was build in the Eastern Germany Days, but its renovated in most parts. I was here many times before and have seen all kind of rooms (make sure, you get an renovated one with Heavenly Bed!). Due to my SPG Platinum Status, this time I had a corner suite with a great view, but it was a old interior... Try the breakfast, its fantastic, but expensive Beside the location the best thing is the atrium lobby ... very old fashioned, but a great spot! My favorite hotel in Berlin!
