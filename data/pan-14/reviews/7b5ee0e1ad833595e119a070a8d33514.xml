I stayed at this hotel a number of years ago now, but from what I remember it was a magical 3 night stay.There were a few problems at check in but we were soon escorted to our room with 2 double beds. It was nicely decorated - although not to my taste. The decor on the whole though was very grand and I particularly have fond memories of a pair of lovebirds situated in a giant metal cage in one of the upstairs lobbies.The restaurants (especially the buffets) were good and the character breakfast was loved by the younger members of our family.Access to the park earlier on in the mornings was also very useful as the place wasn't too crowded. The Disneyland Hotel definitely had the best location of all! Perhaps even better is that I'll be returning July 2008.
