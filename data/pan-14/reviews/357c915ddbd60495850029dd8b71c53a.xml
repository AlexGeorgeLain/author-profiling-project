The hotel lived up to its expectations - the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and the linen immaculate. The air conditioning was efficient and the breakfast was excellent. We requested extra pillows and within 5 minutes our request was granted.The only down side was the distance from the Ramblas - it was a fairly long walk but taxis are fairly reasonable. However, Barcelona FC was only a very short distance and was the highlight of our stay!!!!We picked the weekend of the festival of St John (we didn't know at the time of the booking) and the fireworks continued until about 5 am!! We would definitely recommend this friendly hotel to anyone wanting a long weekend in Barcelona.
