Stayed in this hotel on the 3 nights for the price of 2 package. On the positive side.. smashing location and great breakfast.... but oh .... oh.. on the negatives.....Where do I start.Awful concierge service-absolutely no interest. Booking a restaurant seemed a monumental task. Service generally very poor and why does the chambermaid try to service the room at 8am every morning despite the DND button being activated. BTW, can anyone tell me what I get for my Starwood Preferred Guest status. Very very ordinary.WEEKEND TRAVELLER
