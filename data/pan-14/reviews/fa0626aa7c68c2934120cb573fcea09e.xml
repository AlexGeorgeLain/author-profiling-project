Nice atmosphere, both in the hotel and in the surroundings. Lively nightlife (one night when we returned at our hotel, there were thre guys playing guitar and singing with the audience singing alone, Great!) and a lot of things to do (including good eating and drinking at reasonable prices). Would go there again when in paris next time.
