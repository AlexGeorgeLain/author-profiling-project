Right in the heart of Madrid, a few steps from Plaza Mayor and a really cheap cab ride from the train station. It has been beautifully renovated and if you feel like climbing the stairs you can see some fascinating old photos of Madrid. The rooms are a nice size and spotless. The bathroom was pretty spacious for big city Europe standards, and like the bedroom very newly redone. The staff were really helpful and very friendly. And there is internet -- albeit overpriced -- in the lobby which is terrifically convenient for those last minute flight checks. We only spent two nights in Madrid and so really haven't gotten the feel of the city fully, but I'm looking forward to staying here again next time. It's hard to get a better deal (76E) in the centre of town.
