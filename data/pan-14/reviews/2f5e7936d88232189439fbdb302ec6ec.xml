Hotel La Venere is a stone's throw from the Cathedral (Il Duomo), which basically means that you can reach all the interesting places in less than 10 min. We were quite scared because of some comments we have read about hotels in Florence, but definitely they do not apply to this hotel. Rooms, although not huge in space, are cozy and extremely clean, with your own, pristine bathroom. The whole hotel has been refurbished recently, so everything looks new. The breakfast was good, including freshly prepared coffee on request!But the best bit is the staff. Both Patricia and Rolando were not only friendly, but also extremely helpful in giving us directions and advice or in dealing with problems that we had with our pre-booked tickets for the Uffizi gallery. Very good experience.If you go to Florence, I would really recommend this hotel as a very safe bet.Miguel
