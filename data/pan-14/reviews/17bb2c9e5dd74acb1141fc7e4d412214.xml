Rooms were serviced on a daily basis and the staff were always cheerful and smiling and couldnt do enough to help.Meals were buffet style and the food was plentiful, however after the first week we had gone through the menu whilst they were catering for various nationalities we got bored with the food and ate out. This is also cheap and the local restaurants provide a good range of indonesian european menus.The beach was ok, but not what the picture of Bali conjures up, it was busy, with Banana rides, jet ski`s etc and the sea was not exactly clean there. However it was warm and many ventured into it. There were enough sun beds for everyone towels provided around the pool.Many guests were there for between 2 weeks to 3 months with many returning year on year, this is a recommendation in itself. There are approx 96 rooms which meant you actualy met other people unlike the surrounding larger hotels with 3 times the rooms that appeared half empty. Also be aware of the timeshare reps there, if you go into Kuta and have a meal dont fill in the restaurant questionnaire about the food. You will receive phonecalls stating that you have won a week or other prizes. Also street surveys, these are another avenue for them to get your details and again you will win a week.All in all we enjoyed our stay the Club Bali Mirage and would use it again.
