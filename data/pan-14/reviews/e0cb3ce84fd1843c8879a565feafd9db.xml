Recent construction and noise from the street seemed to be the top complaints, though neither was an issue for me. I booked the hotel on points, and the staff upgraded my room to a renovated suite with a deck on the 6th floor. It is in an alley near the middle of Las Ramblas, and so everything was nearby. There were two computers with free internet access in the lobby, and a carrefore was just around the corner for quick food.

The rooms were pretty small, and having two grown men in them made it feel tight. Air conditioning was non-existent and we weren't able to get irons in the rooms.

There's also a popular shopping street about a block to the east and a night market for food. The pictures don't do the place justice. I had low expectations for the place, and just booked it because of the price. Was pleasantly surprised by the interior and it looks like they've renovated it recently. Staff was helpful arranging tours and shows for us.
