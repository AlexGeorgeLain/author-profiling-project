To be honest I am sure there are other hotels in the area that are better located and even cheaper. The rooms are fine and nicely presented- we had a nightmare on the first night as the aircon/heating system was insane, it must have been about 45c all night and it was making a terrible noise, wow i was hallucinating! Tv was rubbish so dont try to watch it, CNN was the only english language and that almost killed us! Wolf Blizter- is that a made-up name?Each night we had to walk along from the hotel to La Rambla and while it was only a short walk the shortest route was through a weird and dodgey ally that had several intimidating parts- no hassle mind but if you are a paranoid person in a city renound for thieving etc then this is not a walk for you. I kinda enjoyed being away from La Rambla and heading off into it for dinner etc. One good thiing about the location is its simple walk to the main port and the waterfront, a nice walk down there during the day is refreshing. Facilities are not bad here, simple but comfortable bathroom and toiletries provided, good electronic safe for passports etc and it's free for a change. they have lovely spa area downstairs, sauna jacuzzi etc- no pool- but it was a booking system that to be honest we didnt bother with as there is so much to do in Barcelona. There is a great roof top solarium that you can go out to in the sunshine with reasonable views around the city. Didnt even see the bar area but why would you, plenty of places more interesting near by!Only other thing is we never saw a single other guest, which was kinda weird.Enjoy though, a great city so you cant go too wrong.
