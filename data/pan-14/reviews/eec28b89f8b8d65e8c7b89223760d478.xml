What do you call a hotel where the staff are actually people you want to talk to rather than automatons that simply go through the motions? What do you call a hotel where the rooms have character in addition to four walls and a bed? What do you call a hotel that willingly gives you a laptop charger when you've forgotten your own? And what do you call a hotel that's more than a hotel; a place with a soul, a story and a presence all its own?I call it the Drake and as a guest who stayed there on the evening November 26th, I can see myself returning. And an extra congratulations to Jonathan at the front desk for helping create an outstanding experience.
