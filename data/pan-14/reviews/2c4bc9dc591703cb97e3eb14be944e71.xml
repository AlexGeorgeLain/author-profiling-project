Must say it was one of the BEST rooms that I have ever stayed in.Clean ,quite, room was lovely and the bathroom HUGE and everything was spotlessly clean . All of those little extras were there .Location to Darling Harbour was perfect. Just across the road from Chinatown, which was perfect for eating out with friends.Would love to stay then again ,hope to in the future.
