For the journey home, we walked to the Piazzale Roma (bus station) - 20mins and caught the bus to the airport - each, lots of space and 20 mins later we were right outside the arrivals hall. Enjoy your visit to Venice, make sure you try the 'local trendy drink' - Spritz but go with Aperol instead of Campari.
