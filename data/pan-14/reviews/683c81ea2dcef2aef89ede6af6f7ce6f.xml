The bathroom had a great shower-head, and was of a good size. Everything was spotless. We had a corner location without a view, but it was super quiet and the whole experience was one of comfort, ease and a little bit of luxury.Service from staff was prompt, friendly and polite. Came back from dinner to find our bed had been turned down and a plate of fresh fruit on the desk for us. The location is great - a nice walk to the ferry station, across the road from an MTR station and about 5 minutes stroll to Nathan Road. There is a 7-11 close by, and also a Starbucks and Deli-France.Whilst not cheap, the standard room that we booked at the Royal Garden still seemed to be good value for money and I would definately consider staying there again.
