This time instead of staying at the conference hotel I opted for a smaller property. My husband and I loved it. The staff was very helpful, the resturant was excellent, the room was great and the bed was extra lush and comfortable. They have a fellow property which has a pre-fixed early dining menu that offered full size portions of excellent cuisine. Outside the door was the cable car and within a few blocks was China town and down the hill (a few blocks) was the big shopping area...think NYC (where I am from) and Rodeo Drive in LA. Everything they advertised on their website was acurate and in reality it was even nicer. I always review trip advisor on properties before I book, and this was a good one. I would definitely stay there again and recommend the hotel to others.
