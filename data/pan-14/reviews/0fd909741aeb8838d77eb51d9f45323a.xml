I have stayed in many hotels in the SF Union Sq area over the past 30 years, and the Cartwright is one of the best values I have seen! It's older but thoroughly updated, has a very passable serve-yourself breakfast (cook your own waffles, choice of hot and cold cereals, yogurts, fruit, teas, Starbucks coffee, etc.) Rooms are on the small side, but mine had a big walk in closet and bathroom with tub/shower, good quality toiletries. Free WiFi had a very strong signal even on the 8th floor. Complimentary wine tasting in the library every afternoon. Inexpensive valet or self parking. Very helpful staff, I'll definitely stay there in the future!
