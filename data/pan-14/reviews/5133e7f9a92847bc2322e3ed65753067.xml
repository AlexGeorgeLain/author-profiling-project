But, we were so please with this hotel. Overall excellant,great smiling faces by staff. Vallet (these guys weregreat, running for your car and ready to answer allour 1st timer questions). Starbucks, ABC store, hotel stores, awesome restaurants, beach with great sunsets and sunrises, entertainment everynight--- all right there. Great location for shopping heaven. Walking on the beach at sunrise and sunset, words could not express. Our room was in the Diamond head tower, we were given an upgrade for a partial view. The room was small, but perfect for 2 adults, very clean, neat, well decorated with island style.Everything you needed in a room you will not be in much. The bathroom was beyond small,no tub, no space for your personnal items. But, the rest of our stay here, everything was so wonderful, I soon forgot about the bathroom. We would stay here again. Just right****
