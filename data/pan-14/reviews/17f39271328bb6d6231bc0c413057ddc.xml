We spent three days in Venice in between and of all the places we visited I loved Venice the most and can't wait to go back. When I do, one thing is for sure, Hotel Al Ponte Mocenigo is the ONLY place I will stay. For us it was perfect in every respect. Access by vaporetto is so easy both on arrival and every day use. San Croce is a residential neighbourhood and with a little guidance from the owners Walter and Sandro we were able to eat and shop locally and experience the life of everyday Venetians.The hotel is a dream if you want to stay in a place that makes you feel like a welcome visitor, from its elegant rooms, its cleanliness, its gorgeous courtyard and its quietness. Walter gave us excellent directions (this was after we finally acknowledged to ourselves that getting completely disorientated at the Rialto Bridge we were not as clever as we thought and that perhaps a little help might not be a bad thing) and we found him always approachable. The only thing we regretted was that we could not stay longer. Stay at this hotel, you will be glad that you did!
