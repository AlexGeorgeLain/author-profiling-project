It is in excellent condition (quite new I believe), the staff are friendly and helpful and the room we had was absolutely fine - especially the bed. It just seems to lack an identity and character which I expect will come in time.The location is not great as it sits on the busy Wilshire Boulevard (not noisy inside though) and it is a good walk to find somewhere to eat if you want to step out rather than eat in the restaurant which is soulless. The best place to go is up towards UCLA.Forget the pool - it seems to be an afterthought and barely gets the sun.
