		<document id="784bd48ca45b0475d33d904444f0f054" url=""><![CDATA[Great place to stay Stayed in the hotel for three nights with the other half recently.Rooms:The rooms are large by european standards and have two double beds even when you book for two adults only.Accessibility:Ten minuters from schipol.Take the stoptrein from Schipol and get off at RAI Amsterdam.Come out of the station and turn right and right again at the corner of the building you pass next.Its a less than 3 minute walk to the hotel.To go into town take the GVB tram line 4.Retrace the route to RAI station ....you will pass the Drentepark station (50 meters from the RAI....and the origin point of line 4 and therefore always easy to get seats for the 15 minute ride into the city.)Location:In the industrial section of Amsterdam.....therefore not too many restaurants around ....food at the hotel is expensive.... but plenty of restaurants enroute to the city centre on line 4Overall:Absolutely no complaints and a great place to stay
