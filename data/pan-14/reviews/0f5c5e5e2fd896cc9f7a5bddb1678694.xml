The street has recently been pedestrianized but taxis are permitted to enter the street to leave hotel guests although some do not realise this and will leave their passengers by the Metro exit on Puerto del Sol - this means a walk of 30 meters to the hotel entrance. Well worth it! The breakfasts are superb.
