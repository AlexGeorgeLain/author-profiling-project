Just returned from a great few days in this wonderful city.Oct 11-16Great weather,great food,and of course a great little hotel.Catherine and moi spent five nights in the St.Christophe and we fully agree with all the positive comments made here.The hotel itself is spotlessly clean as was our room which was on the 5th floor,with a lovely view over side streets.The staff are friendly and helpful,and really made us feel welcome.A couple of tips to help you on your visit:We arrived from Dublin in CGD at 4 pm.We decided to be adventurous and take the RER to Chatalet then line 7 to Pl. Monge................................a big mistake.Chatalet is a nightmare at rush hour,even moreso with luggage!! Take a taxi its less stressful.About 40mins and 40 euro should see you to your hotel.The 47 Bus is very useful for getting downtown,it drops you back almost at the door of the hotel.Bon Voyage, we will return to the St. Christophe.
