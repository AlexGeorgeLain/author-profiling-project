It is near Times Square, on 40th street, but quiet at night. Staff very friendly and helpful. A delightful visit. We also enjoyed the Pig and Whistle Pub on 47th street near Broadway.We had the pleasure of seeing Les Paul at the Iridium, and recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of Les Paul. The people near us had come from far away to see him.

Gilligan's Island is a great place for snorkeling and general water play, accessible by a ferry from the resort. There is also snorkeling on the reef with Sea Ventures. Yacao has a big shopping center, with lots of places to eat. If you desire to go to a supermarket, there is one near the McDonald's just south of Rte 333. But don't drive into Guanica, (left at Burger King) the roads are being resurfaced and are all torn up.
