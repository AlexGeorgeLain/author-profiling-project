Clean and neat and well-equipped: coffeemaker, room fridge, room safe, iron and ironing board. Nice big clean bathroom. Very quiet room. Nice television with cable. Ice bucket and for once, the hotel provides the can opener. Excellent location. The subway station is right around the corner. Take the #1 uptown and you are everywhere. Walked a few blocks to Tribeca and had dinner at the Tribeca Grill. Delicious. Stopped at a grocery store in Tribeca and stocked up on soda for the room. I'd love to spend an entire week in this hotel and see a lot more of New York. I recommend it to anyone who likes to relax in comfort at the end of a day of trekking all over the city!
