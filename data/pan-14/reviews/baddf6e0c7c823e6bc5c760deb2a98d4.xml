Located right on the canal of the central red light district it will certainly open your eyes. Myself and two friends stayed here for a week and although we were nervous of the surroundings at first it was perfectly comfortable and safe by a couple of hours. A reccommendation would definitely be to relax on the steps to the right of the hostel and watch the sights and characters go by.
