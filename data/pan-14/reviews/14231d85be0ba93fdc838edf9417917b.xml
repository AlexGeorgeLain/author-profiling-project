We were in the section for the Transat Premium, which is really good located.. Near the beach and the restaurant. The beach is so beautiful!We had a private section so there was always chairs that were available. The food was different everyday and very good.. Of course you have some food that is similar but overall it's good! We went to 2 restaurant ( Italian and Grill) and there is enough choice to satisfied everyone. The rooms are beautiful and there's enough space. No problem with the room.. The only things that are kinda bad to me is the service in the buffet.. I think they should have more employees.. I will recommand this hotel anytime
