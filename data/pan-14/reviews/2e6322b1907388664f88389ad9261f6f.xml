My room was very comfortable and it provided me with a great view of the city. I booked directly through the hotel website and booked the weekend deal for $315 per night which included one free movie, popcorn, free breakfast a $40 coupon to use in the bar. When I arrived at the hotel a door man greeted me and I was checked in and walked promptly up to my room. I found this hotel to be distinctive and comfortable . The staff was very helpful and provided me with great service. I dined at the bar and found the appetizers to be ok, I paid $18 for 3 scoops of ice cream. The bar had a great atmosphere but it was a bit over priced. I liked this hotel and I would stay there again
