Located in a lovely part of the city with markets, boulangeries and cafes all within a short walk.We were visiting in snowy slushy december, and the room was toasty warm and snug, with a great outlook over the street. The rooms and the fully fitted bathroom are typical traditional european (i.e. smaller than modern hotels) but beautifully redecorated.Christine, who runs the hotel, is a gem. Forget most of the stereotypes of les parisiens, they are for the most part, charming, graceful and very pleasant. The city just reeks of style and atmosphere.We would certainly return to this hotel.
