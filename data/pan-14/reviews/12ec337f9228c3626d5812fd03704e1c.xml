Our room in the Paradise wing was adequate but nothing special. There was a communal balcony and the bathroom lacked counter space and certain amenities. Breakfast the first day was served cold. We spoke to the front desk about these dificiencies.I must say that on Wednesday, service improved even though the hotel became quite full. The grounds are magnificent, as well as the activities available. The pool was well kept and was enjoyed by many families and children.
