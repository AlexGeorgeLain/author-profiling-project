Paid $150 UAD per night for two people. This hotel has an excellent location--right near Darling Harbour and next to Sydney's Chinatown. Walking distance to main shopping area of downtown Sydney, and to Sydney Harbour (15 minute walk). 10 minute walk to Central Train Station. Rooms are spacious, newly-updated, and clean. Make sure you ask for a room above the 3rd floor (skytrain runs alongside the hotel). Concierge and desk staff were very helpful and pleasant. There is guest laundry and very small hottub and small gym on site. Location couldn't be better, and we felt safe walking in the area and staying at this hotel. Reservations made easily over the Holiday Inn internet site. We would definitely stay here again. A bit pricey but hotels are pricey in Sydney and often hard to get a room.
