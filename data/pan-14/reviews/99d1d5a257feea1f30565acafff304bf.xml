The property is immaculate and while the rooms are quite small by American standards, it was very, very comfortable. The pillowtop bed was outstanding. Don't know where others come off by saying the rooms are tired looking or in need of update, I found the room to be decorated very warmly and the tile in the entryway was a nice touch. The marble bathroom was roomy enough for me and my wife. My only complaint was the showerhead, which is one of those stylish, wide brimmed heads that drip down. I would much rather see an adjustable head. Let me add that there was plenty of hot water. The bedding was in excellent shape, not warn or pilly. Don't know how they did it, but the room was totally cutoff from outside noise. We were on the 8th floor and didn't hear a thing. Interestingly, about 50 feet directly from our room a new building is under construction and the crane was eye level with our window. We didn't hear a single sound from it.Staff was very friendly and check-in was efficient, even though we couldn't get our keys until 4:00pm. We took the opportunity to walk the streets for 4 hours. Being a Platinum member in the Marriott Rewards program I was a bit disappointed to find that the hotel did not have a Club Floor or Concierge Lounge. But the hotel made up for it by providing my wife and I a free buffet breakfast in the restaurant (sorry, it's offered to Elite members only). Since they charge $20/pp for the buffet, we saved a bundle. The location can't be beat for those looking to stay in the heart of Times Square. The Broadway subway has a stop right outside the front door. I would definately recommend this property to anybody wanting to be in the thick of it.
