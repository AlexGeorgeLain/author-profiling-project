The location is great, but as others have noted, easy to miss, as it has a very small street entry that leads to elevators that wisk you up to the lobby.OK view on the 25th floor.. use the 41st Street entrance if you are driving in...valet will park your car, and it was ready when we needed it. all staff, very pleasant and helpful...Clean decentbath..perfect location for walking NYC. we will add this to our list of NYC faves.
