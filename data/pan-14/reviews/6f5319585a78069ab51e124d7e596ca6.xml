It is located within a five minute walk of Westminster Abbey and the Parliament buildings. Our room was modern with funky furnishings although it was a bit small. The washroon and shower facilities were excellent. The room was very clean and serviced daily. Air conditioning and heating worked fine. Service from the staff was friendly and helpful. A nice touch was the supply of free DVDs for viewing in the room. Free wireless internet access was available in the lobby and wired access was available in the room. We did not like the hotel bar very much as it seemed a bit pretentious but there were several excellent pubs in the immediate area.
