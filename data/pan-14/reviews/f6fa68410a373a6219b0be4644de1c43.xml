The room was ok, not fabulous as I expected it to be at the price. We had booked the club level room, and that was our best decision, if you can afford it then go for it. The champagne was flowing, and the food services were small but delicious. Very tasty and we did not feel the need to go to a restaurant every meal time as the food in the lounge was sufficient.The rest of the hotel was nice....but VERY expensive. You have to pay for EVERYTHING you use, even the coffee in the room, which is a little bizarre as it's so very expensive anyway.I would go back and I do recommend it though.Enjoy!!!
