My best buddy and I visited Oahu for two nights this summer completely enjoyed our stay at the ResortQuest. The location is awesome- close to everything we needed! Although it's not exactly beachfront, there is no hotel in front to block the glorious views of Waikiki Beach. The hotel is located in the southern edge of Waikiki, which is great b/c there is less traffic/noise. A short 5 minute walk from the major stores. Check-in was a breeze and the receptionist honored our request for a view of Waikiki Beach. The room was a little on the small side, but ok for us 2 guys. The decoration was in a bright cheery hawaiian floral motiff. Loved the breakfast buffet. We even had a breakfast to-go and ate at the beach. Wonderful. Would love to stay here again next year. Aloha.
