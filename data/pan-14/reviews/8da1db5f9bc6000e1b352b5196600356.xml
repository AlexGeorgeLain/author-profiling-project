The Pan Pacific is marketed as a high range business hotel with luxurious accommodation and top facilities. While the room was beautiful, as was the view, I could not get over the darkness in the lobby and other public areas. The design of the hotel is quite unique, but having the lights dimmed throughout just gives it a gloomy overall impression - as if the power went off and the back-up generator kicked in! I was also unimpressed by the efficiency of the reception staff as it took forever to check in and out. Also, I had specifically booked an exceptionally early check-in, but as I showed up the hotel was experiencing delays and unexpectadly full and I had to wait for 2 hours in the lobby for a room to be vacated. While this is understandable, I would have expected a hotel of this standard to have a Plan B for waiting visitors, ie. a lounge or something. And finally, the Summerhouse restaurant was being renovated during my stay, which meant non-stop drilling and banging noise from 10am to 10pm. So, even though many things at this hotel are excuisite, the experience was not all that great.
