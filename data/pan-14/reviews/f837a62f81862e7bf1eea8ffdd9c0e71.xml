Anyway just few lines to express my total satisfaction for this hotel. As reviews I read said Affinia 50 is a perfect location for your journey. Well located, midtown, near underground stop, near baggels shop and starbucks, close to a supermarket... all the facilites. We had a very beautiful room in the 10th floor. I think the name was junior suite. We had two enormous beds, a kitchen (perfect for preparing breakfast or dinner if you decide to rest a litlle), at least 30 square metres I think. Hotel staff was nice, although I didn't need them a lot, just for asking for an electric switch to charge my european mobile. Just for your interest, we use airport shuttle for a company (the blue shuttle I thing, 8 usd per person more or less and they pick you up at the airport and pick you from the hotel to the airport) and it's a good alternative to a taxi, and cheaper. Coming back to Affinia, I'm looking for bad things, the breakfast price, maybe? As I've said you have lot of chance in the surroundings. Apart from that, I will return to Affinia when I return to New York, the best place I've ever stayed.
