The hotel has a great location, is easy to get to from the airport (trainstraight from CDG stops about 300 metres from the hotel), the rooms clean and the staff very helpful. Only downside was that the rooms were small, but you did have enough room to move around and you much more from a hotel of this price in the city centre
