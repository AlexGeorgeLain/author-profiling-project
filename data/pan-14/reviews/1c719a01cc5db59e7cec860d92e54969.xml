We just returned from a 10 day family vacation to San Francisco where we enjoyed 2 connecting rooms at this exquisite hotel. Every moment spent at the San Francisco Omni Hotel was truly a pleasure! I could not have expected more from our entire experience at this hotel. From the timely communication about the reservation and on-line check-in options, the attentive and warm reception received from each staff member at the time of arrival, the wonderful daily amenities received as simply being a member of the FREE Select Guest program, impeccable housekeeping, exceptional dining through room service and Bob's restaurant, the special kid's program that allowed my daughter to feel just as special as we did each and every day...this hotel has all the bases covered! If you wish for your stay in San Francisco to be a true pleasure for both business and personal travel, you will not be disappointed by staying at this truly world class hotel!
