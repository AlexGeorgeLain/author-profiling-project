We arrived at the hotel about 4 hours before check in and as we were going to a festival all day the staff allowed us to leave our luggage in a locked room which only they have a key for. We eventually checked in around 11.30pm and were seen to immediately with a very efficient service.The room was immaculate and lovely and cool, the bed was enormous. The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which was especially impressive as we were on the top floor!The hotel was very close to the centre of Amsterdam and the train station and therefore very convenient.Slight downside was the lack of restaurant/bar but we were informed of this by our travel agent when booking and we were perfectly happy about this. Breakfast was the only meal included and the hotel provided a continental style breakfast on each floor each morning, whilst this wasn't anything special it was nice of them to offer this facility.Overall I think that the Ibis is a wonderful little city centre hotel, perfect for a short trip to Amsterdam and whilst the hotel is undergoing renovation, they are doing this to improve the hotel for the guests and are trying to make the in between time as easy as possilbe.
