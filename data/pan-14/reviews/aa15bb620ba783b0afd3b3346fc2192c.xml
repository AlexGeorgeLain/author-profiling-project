She had departed the city when she found out about the articles, but knew someone staying at a nearby hotel. I called the front desk and asked who could help me. The desk clerk, Harold, transferred me to the Manager of Housekeeping and I left a message for a callback. I had not received one so at the end of the day I called back again and spoke to Harold. He was very concerned that I speak to someone who could help me so he contacted a live person - the Asst. Manager of Housekeeping, Josie. He apologized profusely for keeping me on hold for only a few moments. Josie was amazingly helpful. She got a messenger service to deal with the articles and I needed to call her back with a credit card number. She said she'd be waiting for my callback and she was!! 20 minutes later!! She greeted me with...I told you I'd be here waiting for your call. I was amazed at the service as there was no rudeness, no sighs because I was asking something out of the way - only HOW CAN WE SERVE YOU! When I'm next in New York, this is the hotel I will be staying at!!
