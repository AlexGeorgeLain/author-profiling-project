I found the staff very friendly, we arrived just as the world cup was starting and wanted to catch the games, the staff gave us a list of all the games/what time they were on and what channels they were on. Did find the food expensive but we didn't eat there so can't comment on if it was nice or not.Location is the winner for this hotel, lots of shops nearby and a few bars/restaurants. We went to fishermans wharf a few times and that means a taxi ride from what i remember it was normally about $12.The only down fall i found was the size of the rooms they were tiny. Would have preferred a larger room.
