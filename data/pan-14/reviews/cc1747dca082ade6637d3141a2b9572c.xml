It is only a short walk to shopping, trolley tours and restaurants. Our favorite restaurant was across from the hotel - Umbria Italian Steakhouse - where you could not find a bad meal. The veal dishes were superb, and the filet was as tender and delicious as any we had ever eaten! If we wanted a sandwich or lunch, we simply turned the other direction and ate at Dooley's - an Irish tavern with a great Irish mixed grill as well as a pleasant atmosphere. The room - actually a junior suite - was quiet and well maintained. Room service was prompt and reasonable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton.
