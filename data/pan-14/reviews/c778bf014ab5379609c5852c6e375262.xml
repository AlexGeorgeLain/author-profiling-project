We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised. Especially after some of the negative reviews on this site. Granted the ride from the airport was a little long, once we arrived it got much better. The staff was great, food was good and the grounds were well taken care of. My wife and I left looking forward to coming back again next year. It did have some downsides but overall turned out to be a fantastic vacation. I highly recommend this property for anyone who likes the all inclusive style vacation.
