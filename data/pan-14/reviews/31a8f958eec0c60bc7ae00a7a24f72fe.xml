The hotel is in a great location close to Potsdamer Platz. The neighborhood is a bit quieter than many central locations and we felt safe parking the car on the street at night. The hotel itself is, of course, very colorful! This is done in a stylish way that makes you smile in appreciation. I liked the little details like the quotes painted on the walls and the inlaid flower designs in the hall carpets. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was excellent, especially that yogurt and marmelade. We had a familly room with an extra bed for our little boy. There was a lot of space there with a very high ceiling. The bathroom was certainly large enough and stylish like the rest of the hotel. The air conditioning issue was a bit annoying, even in early October, as it didn't work so well and things got stuffy. We tried opening the window -- our window faced the inner courtyard, which is generally the quieter place to be -- but then we could hear breakfast being set-up downstairs through the courtyard's glass ceiling at 3:30 a.m.There was no pool, but there's a great-looking swim complex a street away. We didn't get there but would have liked to. There was just so much else to do! So definitely stay here at this lovely hotel, at least from mid-October till it gets warm in the summer!
