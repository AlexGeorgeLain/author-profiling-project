As of February 10, 2008 the hotel was in the middle of construction to renovate it. The work is being done in a way that will not interfere with your stay. I would suggest calling the hotel directly to ask if the construction is finished.We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms. Everything was quite comfortable. You can hear conversations in the next rooms but the noise level is not so bad. On one night there was a very loud party across the street (not at the hotel) that went until the early morning. The hotel of course is not responsible for that, and it seemed to be an exception (it only happened on one of the four nights we were there).Breakfast buffet is great. Staff is great. I couldn't make the wine and cheese from 5-7 pm but I imagine it is also quite nice.Good location for a hotel. We had a GPS in our car, which made it quite easy to explore San Francisco.
