We were pleased overall with the room, and the location was perfect. Typical small European room, but was clean and comfortable. The included continental breakfast was good, and the rooftop terrace was a beautiful place to enjoy it. Service was adequate, though a complaint about a non-functioning television took several days to resolve. Most of the staff was friendly, but some were less so. The location alone is worth recommending. The Beacci is a safe bet for a Florence stay, but for 220 euro per night, we expected a little better service.
