My partner had secretly arranged with the staff to have a bottle of champagne, champagne glasses that were sent over from Bloomingdales, and two tux's to be in the room when we arrived. He even told them what time we were to arrive. Upon check in we were told our room might be ready, and I told them that's ok, we can check our bags, walk around and come back later. Instead, we were sent up to our room. This was simple...the front desk could have stalled by asking us to have a seat in the bar, but didn't. We got to our room it wasn't 30 seconds when the champagne arrived. The glasses tux's arrived some time later...seperatly... mind you, they had been sitting downstairs at the concierge all morning. We were given a verbal appology by the manager, but you can't undo something like that and expect it to be enough. They could have comped the champagne, but we didn't pursue it. I had high hopes for this property by reading all of the postings, but the hotel blew it for me big time.
