I just returned from a 9-day stay at the YWCA Fort Canning Lodge, and I couldn't be happier. The room that I had was large, clean, and quiet. The front desk service was great. All the staff were very helpful and courteous. The breakfasts (included in the price of the room) were excellent. Best of all: the location. This place is a heartbeat away from Fort Canning Park (a must see) and from a major MRT station (Dhoby Ghaut). I'd definitely stay here again.
