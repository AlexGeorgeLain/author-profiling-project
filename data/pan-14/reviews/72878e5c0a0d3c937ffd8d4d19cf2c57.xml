Compared to 5 Golden Apple rated hotels in Mexico that we have vacationed at.....this is nowhere close! Beach is nice, service staff friendly and helpful, entertainment staff work extremely hard - we attended the shows every night and also took part in a couple of games during the day. We were allocated a room on ground floor in main building - overlooking Caribbean street shops - no privacy, plus room was damp and bathroom had mould. Front desk very helpful and we moved next day to a room in a villa (8 in a block). Although this was better, the accommodation could do with some updating - even a coat of paint would help! Tired and not gently used furnishings.....some days I had to call front desk at 5pm to have room cleaned (and I tipped every day!). Leak in ceiling - repaired quite quickly. Food adequate; but no air-conditioned buffets. The a la carte restaurants could be so nice, but, except for the Oriental one, were let down by overcooked, luke-warm food (including the lobster dishes!). Grounds are well landscaped and clean. Seemed to be lots of people at pools - we use the beach all the time. Although resort seemed to be at full capacity, could still get a beach palapa at 8am - a big plus, not having to get up at crack of dawn! I thought the alcohol was very poor - cheap - even the so called Johnny Walker Red Label tasted like kerosene (I am Scottish btw)). We enjoyed ourselves because of the people we made friends with - at disco 5 nights out of 7 - good fun)); however, I would not recommend this hotel.
