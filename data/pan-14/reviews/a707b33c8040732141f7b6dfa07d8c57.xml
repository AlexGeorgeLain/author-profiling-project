It's location near to Placa Catalunya means it is easily accessible via the airport bus ( a half hour trip or so, depending on the time of day) and it is ideally placed for exploring this lovely city.Our second floor room was very modern and minimalist, with plenty of storage space, flat screen t.v. and an efficient air con system which made it pleasantly cool to return to after a day touring the sights. It's proximity to the metro also made it easy to get around if you got tired of walking ! We were aware of an occasional slight rumble (not noise) from the metro, but this didn't disturb us.The bathroom was reasonably sized, warm and well equipped, and the overall standard of housekeeping was very high.There were lovely views and space to relax on the roof terrace, though we didn't use the pool.Our deal included breakfast - good and plentiful with a wide range of dishes, including a selection for those on restricted or special diets. Alternatively, there are cafes close by if you prefer just a croissant and a coffee.Lots of upmarket shopping on Las Ramblas de Catalunya just a short walk to the north of the hotel, but didn't have enough time during our 4 day stay to fully explore the retail opportunities.What a pity - we'll have to return !!!
