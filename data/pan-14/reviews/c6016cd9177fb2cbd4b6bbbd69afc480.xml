Excellent value for money. We got a suite on the seventh floor consisting of a living-dining area, small microwave, coffee maker, fridge and wet bar as well as a great bedroom with a very comfortable king sized bed. The hotel has a lovely atrium and a superb pool with a waterfall and hot tub. They provide a free hot breakfast buffet including cooked to order eggs, omelettes, or pancakes. In the afternoon they have a two-hour party with a free open bar. There is also an Outback Steakhouse on the premises. The hotel has a small gym and a coin laundry. The only thing that needs improvement is the room safe. It operates with a key that is inconvenient and requires an $85 deposit. Overall, it is an excellent hotel if you do not absolutely need to be inches from the beach.
