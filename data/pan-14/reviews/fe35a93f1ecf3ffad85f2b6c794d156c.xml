They recommended great places to eat, and even rang to make resevations. This is a brand new hotel, and delivered everything you see on the hotel website. The room was spotless and very quiet, excellent air-con system. The roof terrace is brilliant, drinks are brought up to you from the bar. Location is great, just a couple of steps from Rocafort metro stop. Cant think of anything negative. Cant wait to come back! Recommend Sazzerak for food, on Consell de Cent 211.
