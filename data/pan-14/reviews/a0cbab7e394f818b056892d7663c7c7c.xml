Me and a friend just returned from a three night stay at La Gioconda and to be honest it was better than i expected especially for the reviews ive seen on here. Check in took literally one minute and we where off to our room, which was surprisingly big for a standard European hotel. The hotel is very easy to find, especially coming from the train station. The hotel is a short walk from anywhere you need to go in Florence, and to top it off there in an internet cafe right around the corner that provides cheep and reliable internet. I very much recommend this hotel for its comfort and its great location. You go wrong by choosing La Gioconda.
