I was planning another trip to Seattle and was able to get a great rate through AAA, and saw no reason not to return. On looking at the first room, we realized that all the furniture was filthy. There were strange stains on the ottoman, and the couch. We asked to be changed to a new room, which they did immediately. The new room was only slightly better. I'm not saying the room was dirty, because it was not. The furniture clearly needed to be replaced though. I put this on the comment card and we were emailed after returning home with an apology from the manager and an assurance that the rooms would be taken out of service and the problem remedied immediately. I would still stay there again, the breakfast, wine tastings and complimentary bike rental more than made up for the shortcomings.
