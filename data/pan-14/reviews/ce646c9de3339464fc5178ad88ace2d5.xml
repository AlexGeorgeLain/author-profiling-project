The bathroom was clean. The hotel is in the center of Florence, in walking distance to everything. The rate included breakfast and free internet in the lobby. I booked this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews. I was not disappointed. I read about Laura and everyone was right, she is a great asset to the hotel. She is very helpful and friendly. She made you feel at home. The hotel does have a small elevator. Overall it is a great hotel and very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be in the center of Florence.
