The Caribe Hilton has a great beach, and there is a breakwater out a ways from the hotel that keeps the water nice and calm. The resort is probably the largest in San Juan and there are huge pools and tons of places to spread out. You won't feel hemmed in here. The grounds were beautiful and the various locations where you could sit down were perfect. Request a room in the Hilton Honors tower, which is the newest renovated part of the resort. The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. We didn't have much a view, but I really didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room other than to sleep and shower. The bathroom was really big and had a great shower. The food in the pool bar was nothing to write home about, but there were plenty of options like Starbucks and a Subway if you just wanted a sandwich during the day. The hotel was maybe 10 minutes from Old San Juan which compared to the 30 minutes from the Ritz or Intercontinental was really nice. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and nice and the service was excellent. The concierges worked very hard to get us into great restaurants and the staff around the pool was very polite and friendly. As far as nightlife goes, the hotel doesn't get that busy at night although on the Thursday we were here, they were having a huge party and tons of young people were here.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I would without a doubt come back here again.
