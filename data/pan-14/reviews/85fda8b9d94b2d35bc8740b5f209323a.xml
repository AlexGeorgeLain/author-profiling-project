Wonderfully located with easy access to transportation (Zoo Station) and within walking distance to major attractions. The hotel is clean, quiet, and the room we had was large by european standards (vaulted ceiling and large marble bathroom). The staff was friendly and courteous. However, when venturing out for the day you must leave you room key at the front desk. Will definately return.
