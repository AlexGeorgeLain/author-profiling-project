I have stayed at hotels that were rated highly and upon arrival I cringed, wondering if the reviews were posted by the hotel staff themselves or crack addicts..But the Affina Dumont! This was a little different.All I can say is wow! We arrived December 26th at 12:15 PM. Early check-in. No problem. High Floor. No problem. From the doorman to the bellman to the front desk to housekeeping, everyone was 100% helpful, kind, and gracious. Not only upon arrival but the entire 7 days we stayed there.And they remained so while checking out and saying goodbye.All I know is from now on when I go to NYC, the Affina Dumont is where I plan on staying.The neighborhood is great. Good bars, restaurants, groceries, etc. Plus if you shop and find you have a lot to bring home, there us a UPS Store up the street. You can drop off all your goodies and they will box it up and ship it back to you.You can walk around town easily from here. I actually walked from Kitchen to the hotel one day at it was a pleasant walk.The 6 line is around the corner and if you know how to use the subway, you can get anywhere you want easily.I really cannot say enough about this hotel.Go and stay there. You will not be disappointed.
