I can honestly say that this Hotel has NOTHING going for it. It's location is a 15min stroll from Shinjuku station but dont be surprised if you see homeless people urinating on the walkways. The area is really run down and is home to many homeless people. Although the hotel (I dont think it can be called a hotel) has a shuttle bus, it only runs from 7:30am - 12pm and 4pm - 10pm. Not to mention the size is not big enough to fit the HUGE amount of guests staying at the hotel. I have also never experienced a hotel that requires FULL payment on arrival. The hotel asked for the full amount prior to even seeing the hotel room which I thought was dodgy and questioned but they insisted it was hotel policy. I now know why they ask for the $$$ on arrival. The rooms are tiny and we were given a King size SINGLE (non exagerration) for the two of us to sleep on. We told the hotel that we had booked a Double room and they said that it was their Double room. If you are considering booking this hotel due to it's relative cheap price, I would recommend you check the room before handing over the $$$. We were going to change hotels until we realised it was an 80% cancellation fee. Dont expect to be spoken to in English. Have your dictionaries and thinking caps on when trying to communicate. However, the Hotel must be commended on its excellent cleanliness which was flawless.
