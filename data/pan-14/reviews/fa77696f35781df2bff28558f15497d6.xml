It's old and it shows. From the dreary drapes to the clean but worn out bathrooms. It's an embarassment to the Hilton name, IMO. It may be cheaper, but really, for $10-$30/night more you can find a much better place to stay and still be close(if not closer) to Bourbon Street.

Staff was courteous, professional and helpful. Well-located in downtown San Francisco. Cost a ton per night, but someone else was paying, haha!
