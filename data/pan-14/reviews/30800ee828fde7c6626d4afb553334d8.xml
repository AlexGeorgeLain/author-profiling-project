The guests occupied a total of 12 rooms. He could not have made a better choice for us! Everyone was thoroughly pleased with their accommodations. The rooms are extremely spacious, well appointed, and very clean. The beds, bed linens and pillows were so comfortable. It was great having a small sitting area with couch (which also opened up to a full size bed), wide screen tv, safe, small refrigerator, and coffee maker in the room. We were too busy to use the pool or fitness room, but several family members did and really enjoyed themselves. Both check-in and out went extremely fast and everyone at the front desk was extremely gracious and accommodating. In fact, everyone working at the hotel went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Parking was simple and convenient, and we really appreciated not having to pay a fee every time we took the car in and out of the garage. Many of the guests took themselves on a walking tour of the neighborhood, over the Brooklyn Bridge, and to the wedding which was held at the nearby Brooklyn Historical Society. They all remarked at what a beautiful, safe area it was. The food at the hotel restaurant for lunch and breakfast was delicious and very reasonably priced. There were no complaints from any of the folks that traveled with us about anything! Now that we have found this beautiful gem of a place in Brooklyn, we will definitely stay here when visiting the city as it is an easy subway ride away from the bright lights and big city!
