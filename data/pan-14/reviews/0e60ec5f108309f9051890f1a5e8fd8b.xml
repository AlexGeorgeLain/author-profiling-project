It was our first hotel in Mexico (after 12 hours flight from Europe). I've red some reviews before, and booked this directly via email. We had double room for 660 peso including breakfast. At check-in I asked for quiet room - and I got this. The breakfast is very good but you don't have to pay in advance. It is even better to pay separately, because you can save a few dollars and have more choices.The hotel is located in the city center, just behind the Zocalo and Cathedral. There are many shops around (even second-hand bookshops on the same street) and some restaurants too. From airport we drove by taxi (127 peso, around 0,5 hour). It is pretty close to Metro stations (Zocalo or Allende) - for just 2 peso you can travel acroos whole Ciudad de Mexico.We were satisfied with this hotel and can recommend to other guests.
