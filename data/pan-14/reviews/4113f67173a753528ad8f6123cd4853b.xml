We left our case with the concierge without a problem.We returned to the hotel at about 17:00, and the room was now available. We were told we had been upgraded to a Superior room (maybe because of the earlier room unavailability?) While the room seem especially superior, it was very well appointed: robes, slippers, iron and board, complementary still water, toiletries etc. The one complaint we had was the noise from a generator (or air con unit) outside the window, however with the windows closed this became only a low hum.We returned to the hotel at about midnight, and the residents bar was still open, and had a wide choice of drinks available.The bed proved to be very comfortable.Breakfast was self-service. There was a wide variety of cereals, fruits, breads and traditional Full English fare. Our only complaint with breakfast was that the eggs were not free-range would expect a four-star hotel to be offering the best quality products on the a hotel I would stay with again, providing the price was right, as it was clean and well located and you ask for more than that!
