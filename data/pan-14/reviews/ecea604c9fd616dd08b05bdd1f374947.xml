The lobby is shared with a noisy slot machine arcade, the rooms are basic beyond belief (ours was directly uner the control tower) and the breakfast would have disgraced a youth hostel. If you feel that this is a worthwhile price to pay for convenience after a long flight, then OK, but check out other Hotels-there are plenty of decent international Hotels within a ten minute taxi rideof the terminal. Perhaps its only plus point is that it would be great for aircraft spotters. When I opened the curtains in the morning, I saw a Convair Metropolitan taking off. Didn't know any of these are still in service-it was the first aircraft I ever flew in-in 1957!
