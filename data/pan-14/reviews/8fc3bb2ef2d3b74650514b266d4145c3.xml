Upgraded to a Suite (to give us more room) but should have got a Harbourview room. Suite had outdated furniture and no view. Great position - direct access from hotel into a great shopping centre. Housekeeping ladies were a lot of fun, helpful and very pleasant. Our biggest gripe was with the concierge/porter staff. Every day we came in with our shopping trolleys/carts full to the brim quite heavy. The staff all stood around watched us struggle to open the doors, struggle down the couple of steps, trundle thru the foyer up the next couple fo steps. We only got service when we banged the carts down the steps and made that much noise that everyone, including the check-in guests, turned to see what all the noise was. I think our next trip to HK we will try another hotel - pity as MPHK was strongly recommended.
