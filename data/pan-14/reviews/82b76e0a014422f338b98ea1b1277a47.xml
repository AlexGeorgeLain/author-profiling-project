It is right on the water and just up the hill is the famous Pike's Market. There is a Starbucks right next door to the hotel. Excellent downtown location, tons of shopping (Macy's, Nordstroms, Nordstroms Rack, etc) nearby as well as wonderful restaurants. You should also check out Ohana's on 1st Ave, which is an excellent sushi restaurant/tiki bar (about a 7 min walk from hotel).

As a HiltonHonors Diamond member, our room was upgraded and we received a good, complimentary breakfast buffet each morning. The entire staff was wonderful, from the bellhops to housekeeping to frontdesk staff. Excellent location too, about 1/2 block to Times Square subway station. Tons of theaters within walking distance as well, not to mention great restaurants!
