The hotel and its staff are wonderful. I believe there are 5 restraunts attached to the hotel, so if you love food, you have a lot of choices.My room was nice although extremely small. I booked an economy room. The bed was probably the best hotel bed I've slept in to date. The bathroom was a little beat up and could use some fixing up. It felt old (which I suppose it is).I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

My room looked out on the very busy Boylston street but was extremely quiet. The only negative thing I have to say about the hotel is in regards to the staff. Every time I interacted with them, I was made to feel as though I was bothering them. The only interactions I had were checking in and out. Lame.If you checking before your room is available, they will hold your luggage for you. However, they do not have a room for luggage and instead store it in the bar, under a counter. They run a wire through the handle and lock it up, but it's still out in the open. There are two computers attached to the internet downstairs, very handy.All-in-all, I would stay at this hotel again. The room/location were nice enough to make me overlook the rude staff members I encountered.
