I upgraded to the suite because I had business meetings and really appreciated having a computer and printer at my disposal since I didn't have my laptop. The restautant is great for breakfast and dinner and prices are reasonable and food is wonderful, especailly interesting vegetarian and vegan options. Staff were immensely helpful and friendly. It is a bit of a walk to Union Square, but if it too long, taxis are so easy in San Francisco.
