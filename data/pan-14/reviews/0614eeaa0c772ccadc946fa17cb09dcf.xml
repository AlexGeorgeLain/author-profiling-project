On arrival the staff are friendly and will answer any questions you have. Although small, the rooms pack a fair amount of punch - they have everything you need! They offer free water and coke a cola, as well as tea and coffee. The beds are extreemly comfortable and the furnishings are wonderful. I rate this hotel and its staff highly - I will be returning!
