Museums, MTR, Star Ferry, shops, restaurants and bars are all within walking distance. The staff is friendly and professional; the rooms are clean and quiet; the food is fine. We stayed seven nights and never regretted our choice. If we ever visit Hong Kong again, we will certainly return to Stanford hillview.
