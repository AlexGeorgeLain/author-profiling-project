From the moment I walked through the door this hotel made me feel good. The room was newly decorated, large and luxurious. The guy that showed me to the room was welcoming and proud of his hotel. Lovely bathroom, big comfortable bed with the softest sheets and a great TV. They even brought me a DVD player within 5 mins of requesting it. Best hotel i've stayed in New York. Great location too.
