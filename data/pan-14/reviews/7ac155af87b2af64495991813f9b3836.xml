Our double room comfortably fit four of us, it was convenient and economically priced and had free parking which is a plus in SFO. Rooms were clean as well as common areas, staff friendly and helpful--- although when we returned around 3 A.M. the front desk clerk was asleep. We walked around the area, infact were out quite late and encountered no problems. There is a lack of good restaurants close by so we had to settle for a little 24 hour burger joint for a late supper. The restaurant in the hotel only serves a buffet or continental breakfast which is below par and way over priced so would recommend avoiding it.

Very disapointing, expensive to get to from Central Station (17 Euro), access is difficult for luggage, as the room elevators are accessed by walking through the restaurant and lounge. They charge high rates for the wireless internet and the breakfast. The room was cold and the bed uncomfortable, certainly nothing to brag about...but worst of all, the carpet in the room and the hallways was filthy. Don't believe the frequent flier promotions they offer, you only get points if you pay rack rate. Not Recomended!
