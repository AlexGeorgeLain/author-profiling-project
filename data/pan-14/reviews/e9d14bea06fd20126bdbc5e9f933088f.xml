The hotel is out of the city center in a mixed residential and business area, adjacent a busy motorway. The center is easily accessable by the metro, through the Mundet station just some 30 meters from the hotel. The metro takes you straight to the centar at Catalunya square in about 15 minutes ride. Try to avoid having a room overlooking the motorway as it can be quite loud if you keep the window open, oterwise with the A/C on, you can reduce the noise quite a lot by keeping it closed. The rooms very quite large and nice. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Definitelly a nice hotel for stays in Barcelone longer than a couple of days for a great price (we payed 50 Euros for a double room, breakfast excluded).
