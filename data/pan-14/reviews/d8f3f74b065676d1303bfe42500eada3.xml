The staff were pleasant and helpful, our room faced the front, was light and airy with a super bathroom. Breakfast with English newspapers - what a good way to start the day! Just round the corner from the Arc, couldnt be better, but be careful when you exit the nearby Metro as all the roads look alike!. Watch the traffic on the Arc - its great fun - crazy but amazing! Have found a new respect for French drivers. L'Essentiale Restaurant nearby a great find. Also restaurant opposite L'Essentiale serves wonderful fish and chips (English style) and you will also be entertained by a magician during your meal. Used our museum and metro passes to visit Versailles which was helpful. A great few days.
