From the fun premise (rooms furnished according to the Dewey Decimal system) to the great location, and helpful librarians, it's a delight. Sparkling clean rooms, all day snacks-even champagne, charming roof deck and a late check out time, what more could you want?

Lots of pillows and environmentally friendly china coffee cups. Breakfast room was always very crowded and could use more seats. We only saw one little elevator but it was quick and never busy. Maybe we just didn't find the others. Enjoyed our stay.
