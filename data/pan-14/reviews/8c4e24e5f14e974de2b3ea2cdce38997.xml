The bedswere some of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. The concierge staff really helped us plan our stay, and gave us great advice on where to eat and some very fun nightlife. Kudos to all of the staff for their friendly, knowledgable advice. My only complaint was that on the last day I became quite sick. I stayed in while my friends did a Napa Valley tour. I wanted to order room service and found out that you may only order lunch between 12:00- 1:00. Now when I see a room service menu that boasts all day it should mean all day'. Other than this we all give this property a high rating. We would stay here again.
