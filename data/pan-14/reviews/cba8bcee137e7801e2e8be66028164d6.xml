And the highest price I've ever paid. Trip was mid-January. Arrival at hotel was after midnight and the only place open was the pizza place. After ordering burgers and sodas , we were presented with a bill for $22. Thought it was all-inclusive (there were some exceptions). So there is nowhere for late-nite snacks as part of A-I. The buffet food was mediocre and institutional. Margarine in the mashed potatoes? Yuk! Lines and waiting to get in at all 3 meals. The soups could have come out of a 5 gallon drum. Lots of pastas, chicken, fish with lots of bones. We were absolutely refused 2 room keys, were told that people lose them, and they could not even make an extra key. Rooms OK. Maintenence timely. Grounds well kept. Few bars, always lines to get a drink. Only 1 bar near beach, long walk, more lines. Shows pretty bad, not even funny. Very few engligh speaking staff. If it were offered again, I would place a value of $199. on this Package.
