Our first room had a busted tub drain and the closet light wouldn't go out (troublesome given the glass closet door. The room is tricky to walk around too. We were given another room, essentially identical, but the Muslim room, so plus prayer mat and minus booze. It's great they are so accomodating but kind of an odd room to give an Irish guy. Had to prop a bag on the closet door to keep the light out there too. The aggravating part is that it was virtually impossible to reach the front desk. Phone rings and rings, then the operator promises a call back which never comes. Then we go down, and presto, people all over the place (who don't seem THAT busy that they can't at least answer the phone. Screwy.
