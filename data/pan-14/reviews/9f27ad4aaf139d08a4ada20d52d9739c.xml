The rate was excellent (it came in below the GSA/CONUS rate used by government travelers) and the hotel was very close to our clients, a Spanish government agency.The room was quite nice, although the entire hotel is loud because there is no carpeting anywhere. All the hallways are tile, very loud, and the rooms have hardwood floors, also very loud. I could hear every step my upstairs neighbor took. This wasn't a big problem for me, as I was there purely to sleep, and I am a heavy sleeper, but my colleague, who had a third floor room, found sleep elusive at night and work impossible during the day because footsteps and other noises carried due to the un-muffled floors and plumbing,. etc.. The bathrooms are lovely, the hotel provides slippers and bathrobes, and a complimentary bottle of wine the first night.Internet charges are steep for a luxury hotel. I did not try any of the dining options. The location is excellent. It is very close to the Thyssen and the Prado and the Parque del Retiro. I would stay there again next time business takes me to Madrid, although my colleague would choose a quieter locale.
