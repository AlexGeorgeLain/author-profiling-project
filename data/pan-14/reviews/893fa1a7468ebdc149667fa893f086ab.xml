Very easy to reach (5 minute walk from the train station - train direct from airport, and as expected in Germany train on time). Staff were extremely friendly and helpful during booking process and throughout our stay. The price was truly impressive - 513 euros for 4 nights, an absolute bargain. The room was large, with a 6 foot bed (luxury), italian coffee maker and lovely fluffy robes. Only complaint would have to be the lack of english language tv channels available. Both mini bar and room service prices were extremely reasonable.Located on the K'dam, beside the zoo, just around the corner from Ka-de-we and a stone throw from Tiergarten, an excellent location to explore all Berlin has to offer.Would thoroughly reccomend this hotel, particularly if you manage to get a bargain rate.
