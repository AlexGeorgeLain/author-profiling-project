When i booked this hotel i was quite worried as i had read some not so good reviews!! but i arrived home from the rialto lastnite and i have to say that i had no complaints what so ever!!When we arrived the staff were very friendly and helpful and it only took us a few minutes to check in. The hotel room was a good size as there was three of us staying in the same room, but there was plenty of space!The only thing i will say is that when we walked past other rooms some of them did look on the small size but we obviously got one of the biggest because there was 3 of us. I suppose its the luck of the draw what room you are given, we stayed in room 428!The room was cleaned every day and new bedding, towels etc without fail!I would 100% recommend this hotel, it has lots going for it! Fantastic location, clean and friendly and the breakfast in the morning keeps you going until tea time!Its sort of down a little high street so when you are walking down there be extra careful for pickpockets beacuse i got my bag pinched off my arm just down the road!! but that could happen anywhere in barcelona!!Overall i rate this 10 out of 10!!
