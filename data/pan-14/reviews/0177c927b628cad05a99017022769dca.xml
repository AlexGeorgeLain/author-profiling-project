Bathrooms in need of refurb but would still recomment this hotel and stay here again. Staff very friendly. Pool bar very popular especially at happy hour. Personally don't like Indonesian food but cakes fabulous and breakfast okay. Top tip get up early to get a sun lounger, seems that pool man may be earning a few rupiah by reserving for some guests - you know who you are. Evening dance entertainment excellent.Very friendly place, clean well kept and beautiful gardens which are sprayed each evrening to keep insects at bay, beach lovely -slopes a bit into sea but quite fun getting in and out.Best in Sanur and good value.
