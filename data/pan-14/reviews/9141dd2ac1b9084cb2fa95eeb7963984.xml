This place tops them all!Concierge that will do anything. They are happy to see children. We stayed in a fourth floor room looking out of the Ave George V. I was afraid it would be noisy. The windows must be two inches thick. Not a sound.Perfect English and French speaking staff. Charming, fun, relaxed. Everyone has smile like they know you know you have just arrived in the most wonderful slice of heaven in the most exciting city.Expensive but I'm happy to pay it now and again soon.
