Customer service was adequate and the room was neat clean. Furnishings were new modern. The price was right for me: 120 USD or less per night. Great location: close to the Leidseplein Rijksmuseum and away from the tacky / seedy Red Light and Central Station areas. That said, everything in Amsterdam is walking distance. Did have a little bit of a mosquito problem, but that is to be expected any where with all those canals and no AC (necessitating open windows).
