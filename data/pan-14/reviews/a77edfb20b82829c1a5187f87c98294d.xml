As other reveiwers have mentioned, this is a 5 star+ hotel for a 4 star price. Yes they might miss some special features to get the 5* rating, but none that we missed. We had an fantastic roomy suite, which felt like home and was kept very clean and nice during our entire stay. The staff of the hotel, without exception, was very friendly, helpful and courtious with a special mention for the business lounge staff. The location is also excellent with many tourist attractions within easy reach. Great value and we definite recommend this hotel to travellers to Beijing.
