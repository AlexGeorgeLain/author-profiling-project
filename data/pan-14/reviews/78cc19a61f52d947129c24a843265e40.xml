The location was excellent, check in was easy, staff were attentive the attention to detail was second to none. I would recommend Jurys in Boston 100% would use the hotel again if I were to return to Boston in the future.

We were warned away from staying in the wharf as it is so touristy so we were slightly worried before we got there but no need, the Wharf IS full of tourists but then so is most of SF! We felt like there was plenty to do in the area plus we felt safe there too. The Argonaut was beautiful, the room was spacious and cleaned to perfection everyday. We had everything we could possibly need, coffee maker, toiletries, iron, ironing board etc etc. The staff were super helpful very well informed. The only problem is the restaurant attached to the hotel, which in my opinion is awful and really lets down the Argonaut. We had dinner breakfast in the restaurant and both times had to send some of the food back, as did a lot of people we noticed. The are plenty of other places to eat though in the Wharf so there is not need to eat in the hotel restaurant anyway. I would really recommend the restaurant opposite to the Argonaut, also Ciopinos is great too.
