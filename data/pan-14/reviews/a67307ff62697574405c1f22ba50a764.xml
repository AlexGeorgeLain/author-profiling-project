I was worried, having never been to Amsterdam and staying in a lowly rated hotel, but the reviews from the travelers were good. I always trust fellow travelers over travel critics. I was pleasantly surprised when we got there, we got there way before check-in and they held our bags for us so that we didn't have to walk around the city with them and offered us complimentary breakfast even though we weren't checked in yet. The staff was amazingly friendly, everyone was very nice and gave us recommendations of places to go. The rooms were small with a tv, minifridge, and a private bathroom. They had the most amazing windows, I loved sitting on the window sill just watching the city in motion. The free breakfast was great and in a cute little room. The best part was the location. It was within walking distance of most places. If you are looking for a five-star hotel this isn't it, but if you are looking for a clean, safe, convenient, cheap hotel this is the pick!Warning: If stairs are a problem for you, don't stay here. Depending on you floor you will easily be required to climb at least 100 steps if not more.
