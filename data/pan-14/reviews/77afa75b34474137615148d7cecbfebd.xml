The hotel design was really modern, and we really enjoyed the big space of the room. And we didn't have any problem with the location, since the hotel located exactly next to bus terminal. Just hop on to light bus no. 69X and it will bring you to the heart of Causewaybay(not far from Sogo). And not to mention it's much cheaper than taking a shuttle bus provided by the hotel. Overall, I would say Le Meridien Cyberport it's one of the best hotel that we have ever stayed in Hong Kong
