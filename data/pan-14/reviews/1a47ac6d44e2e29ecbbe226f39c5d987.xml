It was incredibely noisy, because it is just in front of the two big roads and has large non-isolated windows. We asked for another room after a night of non-sleeping and we got room 209 which was very calm and not noisy at all. It's true that the rooms are a bit noisy, but hey, you're in a hotel in the middle of a big city... If you can, ask a a room at the back of the hotel, no noise from the outside and less neighbouring rooms...Rooms are not very big, but again... it's a hotel in a big city.Service was ok, we got free bottles of water the day we left.
