Its public spaces are among the finest examples of traditional elegance one is likely to encounter. Its location across from the Thyssen and very close to the Prado museums make it exceptionally convenient for tourists. Service was impeccable, with an appropriate mixture of formality and friendliness. I have noted that there has been some criticism of rooms amongst reviews of the hotel; we found our quarters attractive, in perfect condition, consistent with the rest of the hotel. We appreciated internet access through the television, as we had not carried a laptop with us. I should also note the excellent restaurant, Asia Gallery. We both loved it and count it as one of the finest dining experiences we have had recently. The breakfast buffet in the rotunda was top notch as well.
