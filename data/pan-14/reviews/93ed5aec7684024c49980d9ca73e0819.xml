This is certainly a four star resort, given that it is a smaller resort than the Tropical Princess and the Caribe Princess which are both next door. You can eat or participate at all three resorts if you want to.The food was excellent for a Carribean resort, and this is our seventh trip to the Carribean. The Tex-Mex steak house did a fine job on beef or chicken, and the Italian restaurant at the Punta Cana Princess was excellent, far better than the Italian restaurant at the Caribe Princess. The buffet had a different theme every night, and if you didn't like the night's theme then you could take a five minute walk next door to the Caribe Princess and sample their buffet, which was larger because the resort is larger. No premium booze unless you paid extra, but the Spanish wine was better than passable, and who needs a lot of premium brands when you can sample the local rums and liquers for comparison. Nice rooms, average maid service, the front desk could not change a US20 into smaller bills to use for tips, so I didn't tip for the first few days. Finally got them to change US$ into Dominican pesos, and spread a few of them around, but it didn't seem to make much difference, the service was average if you tipped or not.We read about the malaria scare before we left, and found out it was not people at the Princess resorts who had contracted it, so we went with some heavy-duty deet stuff just in case. Never saw a mosquito all the time we were there. We will be going back for sure.
