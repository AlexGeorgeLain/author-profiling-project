I had a hard time finding a decent place downtown that would allow pets for under $125 a night. This place was the best compromise under $100. It is in a nice middle class neighborhood but is on one of the busiest surface streets in the city so there is a lot of road noise. The top floor rooms have a vaulted ceiling which is nice and the rooms were old but clean. This is an older motel. Having just left a Carmel BB that was not much more expensive than this motel, it seemed expensive for what you got. It is convenient to most of the tourist attractions and there are several decent restaurants within walking distance. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
