I chose the property because it was one of the only choices (combining air hotel) that had a room with 2 double beds as an option for a good price. Front desk staff were very efficient. We arrived in the early morning and they had us in our room by 11:00am. Our room, on the 5th floor, was just fine. A little dated perhaps, but clean with comfortable mattresses and pillows. No problem with the location as we purchased 3 day MUNI passes and the hotel is on the corner of 2 busy streets (Van Ness and Geary). We took the BART from the airport to the Civic Center and walked the rest of the way (about 13 blocks). The beginning of the California cable car line is close and easy to get on without waiting. We walked to Union Square the first day. Had one dinner at the hotel and it was nicer than expected. Staff throughout this hotel were pleasant and helpful (front desk, bell boy, cleaning staff, waiters) and our checkout took seconds. Took the shuttle back to the airport as it was reasonable. Cathedral Hill Hotel delivered as a good budget choice. (I have stayed in the tiny rooms around Union Square on previous trips.) Shopping in SF is fabulous and I would rather spend my money that way! If you are going in September 2008, be sure to see the Frida Kahlo show at the MOMA, ending on the 28th.
