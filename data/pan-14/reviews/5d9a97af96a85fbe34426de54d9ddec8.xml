The bed in our room had mites on it and the sheets were dirty, toilet was dirty and the flush did not work. We called for housekeeping but they proved to be very busy and they never turned up! Are we expected to sleep in that bed??????We immediately checked out on that day and stayed at another hotel nearby, which proved much better than this one! Bali is a beautiful place but we are never going back to Legian Beach Hotel to stay anymore!
