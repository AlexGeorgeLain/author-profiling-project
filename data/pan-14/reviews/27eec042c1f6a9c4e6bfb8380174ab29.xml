Our room was on the 6th floor and it was absolutely fine. Two double beds, plenty of space, a safe, proper closet, tv, etc, etc. The room was clean and we had no problems whatsoever on that front. The staff were all very friendly.There is a restaurant joined to the hotel, which we didn't eat at so I can't tell you about that. We had breakfast at an Irish pub called Lefty O'Doul's just two doors down from the hotel which was convenient. You can also have evening meals and drinks there. We had a couple of drinks at the bar round the corner, where there is live music every evening.I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a good, clean and budget-friendly place to stay in the heart of San Francisco.
