The products in the bathroom were awful ! and the bath and shower tiny .the beach area of the hotel was great - except due to high winds on waikiki ,the staff refused to put the umbrellas up - understandable -s0 all guests crammed into pool area .tried to order a expresso from the bar there - sorry the machine is broken !!!!The hotel is closing next yr for a massive renovation ...my suggestion is stay there after its done ..or go stay at the the moana surfrider which is now undergoing renovation by the westin hotel group ... we checked out after 2 nights at the royal and went there to the historic wing of the moana ....IT WASA GREAT MOVE ...TRUST ME !!! very enjoyable
