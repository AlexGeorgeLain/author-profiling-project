This hotel was really nice!!!From the check in where the receptionist was lovely - they didn't have our room ready so placed us on the 32nd floor - - -amazing room.You can even hear the TV with a seperate speaker in the toilet!!! (Small things I know)Great views, perfect service - made a really good coffee for us and they had amazing service aswell...Much better than when it was a Rydges!!!
