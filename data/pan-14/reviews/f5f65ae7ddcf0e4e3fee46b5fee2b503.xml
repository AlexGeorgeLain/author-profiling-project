We loved the hotel and highly recommend it to anyone thinking of staying there. The location is great, we didn't have to use public transport at all, and could easily cover all the main attractions in Florence by foot. It is literally steps away from the Duomo, and makes you feel in the thick of all the action in the city. The rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was efficient. They also had a decent continental breakfast. In summer you can make use of the outdoor seating on the terrace which has a great view of the Duomo. It is also at a walkable distance from the train station.
