Spectacular view from our room of the Mississippi River and French Quarter. Lobby was beautiful and service was excellent. I was a little dissappointed in our room due to the contemporary styling - I prefer an old world look, more New Orleans feel - but this is just my opinion. I didn't find the rooms very sound proof either. I heard the neighboring rooms come in at 2:30 AM and 4:30 AM. Other than that - the rooms were very clean and everything is brand new - beautiful white duvet comforters on the bed, flat screen TV, etc. Service was outstanding.
