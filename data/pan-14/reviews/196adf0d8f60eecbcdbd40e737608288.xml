The hotel is very charming. The rooms are not very big, but very well decorated and very clean. The bathroom, an important issue for me, is very good, in marble, and immaculate clean. All the staff was very friendly. The hotel is well located. The drinks in the mini bar of the room are free of charge, which is very unusual, but very agreeable. I discover the hotel here in the trip advisor and I strongly recommend it.
