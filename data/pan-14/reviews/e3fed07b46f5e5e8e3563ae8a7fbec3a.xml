You can walk to all the main attractions, and David is almost close enough to climb in your window! We spent 3 weeks in Italy,and this was my son's favorite hotel of the entire trip.We had a true triple room with remote-control in-room air conditioning and wireless Internet in the room.Such amenities aren't easy to find in Italy,and we really enjoyed having them.Breakfast here was also our best in the country.Don't be frightened by the building's outer appearance-it's a downtown building in an ancient European city.Also nearby is i'Toscano,a very reasonable restaurant with some dishes in lighter sauces than many Italian locations. Thanks for a great experience in a very relaxed city. John Huffman,Battleboro,NC,USA
