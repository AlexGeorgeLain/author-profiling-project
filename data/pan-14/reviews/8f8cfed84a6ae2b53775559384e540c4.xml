It was a wonderful hotel from the time I walked into the lobby till the time I walked out of it there was not 1 problem. Hotel staff was great and whenever I wanted something within mins they were at my room with what I ordered. Had great views of the Harbour Bridge and opera house. Rooms are great, everything inside is modern.Would 100% suggest if going to be staying in Sydney to stay here.
