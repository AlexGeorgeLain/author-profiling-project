Rooms have a safe, fridge, microwave, coffee maker and free internet connection. You definitely want to get a deluxe room with the bed/couch combination. The rooms are much larger, have a great bathroom layout, and a balcony - perfect for a couple. The location was within walking distance of basically everything and the beach was only 3 very short blocks away. The service was very good for the most part, but the front desk has a bad apple or two. Speak to the Asian lady - she is sweet and really goes out of her way to help you. Okay the bad: This hotel has very poor noise insulation thanks to louvered windows. The garbage truck will surely wake you up every morning. It shows up between 6:30am and makes an incredibly loud racket that will rudely awake you. I found it to be a common topic of conversation between guests in the lobby, breakfast area and elevators. The hotel parking lot only has about 15 - 20 spaces. I had to park at a sister Aqua property about 2 blocks away. Not that big a deal because the blocks are super short, but I was still charged the regular rate of $18 a night? Finally at night the last block just before the hotel is a little dark, it made my girlfriend a little uncomfortable. Just know going in that you get a bargain without sacrificing some pleasantries. If you stay here the ear plugs and hope for parking availability.
