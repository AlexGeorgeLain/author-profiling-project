Having read the reviews I was confident I'd be comfortable there since I wasn't looking for anything fancy several reviews stated that the staff was very helpful. I couldn't disgree more.When I first arrived the hotel only had me staying for one night and had me wait over an hour until they resolved the problem. When I approached the lady at the front desk to inquire about my situation she would walk away leaving me mid-sentence. They didn't apologize for their mistake acted like it was my problem.The next day I couldn't get into my room, for whatever reason the key wasn't working again I encountered the same attitude.On my last day I asked if they had a courtesy room for guests who have late flights, friends I went with had this option at their hotel. The attendant was very sarcastic in her response and said no, maybe at other hotels where you pay more.The bed was like sleeping on a rock the noise level at night was almost too much. After reading the reviews on this hotel I went there with an open mind a positive attitude, but was terribly disappointed wouldn't stay there again.
