The bathroom had a tub and a separate shower. There was no view, our window faced another building, we could hear delivery trucks in the morning, and loud bangs of the doors by the service people. On the first night there was no turn-down service (it was Sunday), on the second day room service did not leave enough toiletries (they said they ran out of them). The biggest disadvantage was the lack of in-room tea/coffee maker. Front-desk informed us that they are available to rent for 30$ per stay, and the reason for their absence was that the hotel was trying to position itself as a luxury brand on par with Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons. A note about the gym - it is pretty spacious and has good equipment. There is also a small pool. Location is good with a short walking distance to South Water station, and 15 min walk to Tremont Street. A number of coffee shops, including Peet's and Starbucks are in the adjacent business district, and there is a good seafood restaurant across the bridge from the hotel.
