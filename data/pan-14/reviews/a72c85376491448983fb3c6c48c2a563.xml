What a pleasant surprise to find an updated, clean, quiet facility. They have a business center with 4 computers and a printer available at no cost, a fitness center that had enough equipment to satisfy anyone, a pool table and ping pong table and a large room set up with tables and chairs for the complimentary continental breakfast with coffee, espresso, capuccino, tea and juices available till 11:30 pm. In the evening they had alcoholic beverages and sandwiches available at reasonable prices. A pool, hot tub and washing machines and dryers are also available. It was a $10, 10 minute cab ride to the beach. Overall a very pleasant experience. Hotel staff was very cordial and informative.
