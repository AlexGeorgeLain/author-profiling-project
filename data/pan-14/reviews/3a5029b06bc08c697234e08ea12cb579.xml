The location is very convient and easy to walk to lots of downtown spots. The front desk and door personnel were very friendly and efficient. This is a decent hotel and I found it to be reasonably priced.The room was a king on the 5th (?) floor and it was very tight, but the bed was comfortable and they offer a choice of pillows - nice touch. I found the noise from the roof of the next building a bit annoying, but this is a downtown hotel, after all. Unfortunately all they had was a smoking room and there was a mild odor, but I bought some room deodorizer and it seemed to do the trick.The bathroom was very sleek, but with limited space for toiletries. The major minus was the shower - I'm of average build and could barely turnaround! In the end I found it kinda of funny, but would have preferred more shower space.I would not likely stay here again, only because I would prefer a bit more space in the room.
