The difference was like night and day!There was a big screen TV, comfortable king-sized bed, and a partial ocean view for the AAA room rate of $215. The room originally asssigned to me was barely worth half that amount. To their credit, Lisa at the front desk acted swiftly to remedy this problem. Generally, it was well maintained , but this older (I remember it as the Hawaiian Regent in the Seventies) property still felt like it had a way to go before it would be worth the money to any one paying more than I did per night. The hotel was not shy about squeezing you for the extras, either. Approx. $14 a day for use of the internet, $20 a day for parking, and $1 for each local phone call. Be prepared for lots of large tour groups as well.In sum, a decent place to stay, but be very careful of the rate you pay, and don't be afraid to speak up if you don't like your room.
