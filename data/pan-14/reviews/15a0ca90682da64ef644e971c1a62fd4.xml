It is a short walk to and from Amsterdam Centraal Station and so was convenient for coming and going from the city. It is right near Dam Square and is about a 15 minute walk from the Museum Plein, Anne Frank House, etc...we walked everywhere from here easily. They had a nice breakfast that was not a buffet, but rather was served to you. It included bread and a soft boiled egg. The rooms are accessed by a narrow spiral stair case (or small lift) and the hallways and narrow, but slope and lean wonderfully. It felt so authentic staying here. We had the Breitner room and it was great---canal views. There are a few places to eat literally steps away as well. If you want to stay in an authentic canal house with just enough classy amenities, then this is your place.
