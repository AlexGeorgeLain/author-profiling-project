We left the CDG airport via Air France Bus which stops right outside the hotel across the street. The Metro is also right across the street. We stayed in room 507 based on another review we read here and we loved it. The room was nicely decorated. We slept with the balcony doors open for the cool breeze and it was relatively quiet, except for the occasional ambulance passing by. The view of the ARC was awesome! When I stood outside on the balcony I felt like I was looking at a painting. There was even a balcony in the bathroom although you could not see the Arc from this balcony. The room and bathroom both were large for Europe standards and they were very clean. Staff are very friendly and efficient. I will definetly stay at this hotel on my next visit to Paris.
