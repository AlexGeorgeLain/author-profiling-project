The shower and toilet room was tiny - the sink overlaps the toilet pan and there's very little room to turn round in the shower. The carpet was threadbare, the ceiling was damaged and the tiling in the bathroom needed re-grouting. Well over-due for a make-over.I saw nothing to merit the advert on the side of the boat which said luxury rooms from There weren't even any tea or coffee making facilities.The Botel has moved from its original position and is now a 10-minute ferry ride up the river, so less than convenient for the night life. On the plus side, the ferries were free and run frequently. On the down side, if you miss one, it can be half an hour before the next one so you really need to plan your trip out. It's also not very convenient if you want to go back to get changed or if you forget to take something with you.I must admit that I'd been told it had moved but it wasn't clear exactly where it had moved to. Google Maps still show it in its original position.Considering I booked in January and paid for two nights, I came away feeling ripped off. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel. I wouldn't go again.The traveller photos on TripAdvisor.com are more indicative of the reality ... particularly the one called the BotHell.
