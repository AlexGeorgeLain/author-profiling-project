The lady at the tour desk was very helpful and patiently answered all of our questions. Her help was invaluable. I recommend buying the muni pass for unlimited travel (available at the tour desk). It more than pays for itself especially if you want to ride the cable cars more than once or twice.The rooms were charming and provided more amenities than many brand name hotels. I would classify it as a genuine boutique hotel and highly recommend it to everyone. I am a retired airline employee who's traveled the world and I know a bargain when I see one. Folks, this is it!Date of stay: May 18-20
