Fast, efficient check in. However, this hotel is being rennovated, it would appear. Moved rooms after 3 nites due to party crowd next door to 24th floor. 30th was old carpet, wall paper coming off. 24th was very clean and nice!! Pool service was poor, breakfast options not great. Location is good, though slight walk to get to good beach which is in front of the Royal Hawaiin.Used the Concierge once, and she was wonderful, fun and accurate. Very crowded and had it not been for the convention, would have been outnumbered 9 to 1 by Asian crowd. I think there are better options in waikiki, but this hotel os ok.
