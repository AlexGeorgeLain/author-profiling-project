The rooms in the fron ttower are better in my opinion, seemed more modern and spacious (we stayed in both). We didn't make much use of the facilities, you don't need to as there are plenty of good restarants nearby in the Zona Rosa. We found it perfectly safe to walk around, including walking homee after eating out in the evening. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. Although not in the Historic Zone this is well away from the dense traffic and crowds in that area - and the better for it. You are roughly midway bewteen the Centro Historico and the Park and can walk to either (its about 40 minute walk to the Zocalo. It's also only about 20 minutes (depending on traffic) from the airport - so is good for shorter stays.
