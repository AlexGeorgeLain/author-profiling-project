However, for the price, I supposed I am not in the position to complain. Everything was so basic, the bed was so hard, the blanket was so thin, and any view from the window was non existance. The only plus points I can think of was the bathroom, which was newly renovate. Moreoever, its in the middle of nowhere and you need to take a bus or a taxi to get to the city or the nearest shopping center, Vivocity. I will not recommend this hotel unless you are really tight on budget.
