Lots of restaurants and supermarkets in the area for a quick bite or a sit-down. About 20 minutes from Place Bastille. 5 minutes from the Nation metro and train which then connects with all of Paris and beyond. Less than 1 hour and 8 euros from De Gaulle airport. A little over an hour and 2 Euros from Versailles. The hotel is not in the luxury class but a very good tourist class hotel.Very clean room, linen, bathroom. Staff always cheerful and ready to provide advice. Highly recommended! We would return here when we are in Paris again.
