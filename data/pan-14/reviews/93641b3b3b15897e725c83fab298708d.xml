Location is very good, just at the top of the high end shopping street (Gracia), and walking distance from many of Barcelona's main sights (Gaudi buildings, las rambla etc). The beach is a short taxi/bus ride away.Initial impressions were very good - amazing building, set just off a busy road so not too noisy. Bags were taken at the door by attentive staff. Check-in was very good and quick. We arrived at around 230 and were taken to our room straight away. Clerk also immediately gave us a map with the hotel on it and briefly explained it's proximity to local points of interest which was a nice touch.Room on the 5th floor was very nice with high class furnishings and large comfy bed - not huge in area, but then that doesn't really bother me. Beautiful views over La Familia and the city from the balcony. The bathroom was huge, with double sink and great whirlpool bath.Turndown/cleaning all done well and around our timing. Complementary water was nice, and bathroom kit was first rate. Also notable is the sound-proofing. There appeared to be a local festival one night, but we couldn't hear a thing! Downstairs bar is very pricing, but also very nice for (probably only one) drink. Concierge was also excellent, and recommended a very good restaurant in the mountains.Overall an excellent hotel.
