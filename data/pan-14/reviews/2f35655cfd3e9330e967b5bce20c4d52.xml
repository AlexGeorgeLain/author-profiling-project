We like to make long weekends in the city and there are many features that other hotels just can't offer. The location, in Pacific Heights, is incredible. The neighboring 2-3 blocks consist of the most elegant homes in the city. Really, they are mansions with values of $10 plus with incredible views. The Drisco is also within walking distance to eating and shopping on Union Street and Filmore Street. If you want more than the big department stores downtown, this is a great place to stay. The Hotel is very quiet, very comfortable, and the breakfast and evening wine/snacks is very well done. While you can't realistically walk to Union Square or the Wharf, it is only a $10-$12 cab ride to almost anywhere in the city. The bus system is also very efficient and a great way to see new areas of the city.
