The facility is very clean, even the beach washrooms were spotless and always decorated with fresh flowers. The choice and variety of food was very good with the sole exception of Le Gourmet restaurant where the food quality was well below expectations. After talking to other guests at the resort we discovered that all who had dined there agreed. The staff is friendly and very accomodating. It does sometimes take some patience to explain what it is that you are asking or want. If I have a criticism it is that Sunquest provides absolutley no information on arrival and you have to fend for yourself (asking questions, walking around and exploring) until the next day when the orientation takes place. So next time we will book directly and arrange for our own flights. We will definitely return to Melia Caribe Tropical!
