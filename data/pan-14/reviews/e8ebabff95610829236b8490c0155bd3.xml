Heck the rooms are so tiny and you don't have space between twin beds and if you got a big luggage like me and my sister you will likely to have problems moving around the room. The only good side on this hotel is that it is near the MTR and Nathan Road and it pays of real well if you are really tired because of the long walk and in front of our room has Ice dispenser which came in handy at night when I need a drink of beer. Stay away from this hotel. You are way better off on other hotels near the area.
