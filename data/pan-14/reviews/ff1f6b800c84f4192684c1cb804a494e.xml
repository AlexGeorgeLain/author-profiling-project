If this Courtyard was located anywhere other than near the San Juan airport, it would be rated a 4-star Marriott. The hotel is very nice and has the amenties and small touches you would expect from a more expensive beach resort: quality linens; comfortable beach chairs; cozy hammocks for 2, shaded by nearby palm trees; several on-site restaurants; its own (very clean) beach; large swimming pool with a swim-up bar, and more. Our room was large and clean, and our outdoor patio faced a lovely stretch of beach. For us, it was well worth the tradeoff of the flights, which in truth didn't even bother us. We would definitely recommend this hotel. Request a room facing west, on an upper floor, when you make a reservation.
