However, it turned out to be a good choice. Very positive first impression in foyer, and staff very friendly and helpful. Room on 5th floor, decent size, good bathroom, plenty of towels, toiletries etc., very clean. No balcony, and at the back of the hotel, so quiet, but not very exciting view - ok for one night, but not so great for a week.Cost - 100 euros per night, room only. Didn't investigate breakfast, as took it out in a cafe - usually a better option with continental hotels.Location- on busy Av Diagonal. Residential and shopping area, quite classy. Bus stop right outside the door, and choice of several, plus others about 2 minutes away. The nearest metro was about 10 mins walk, downhill (but up on the return !), and not on a very good line for getting to most of the major sites - you needed to change for most things. However, the bus service is excellent, and if you avail yourself of a route map from the tourist office/ info kiosks it is very easy to follow, and much more flexible than the Bus Touristic, which many people recommend. especially if you fancy doing things that aren't necessarily touristy. Buy a Barcelona Card - online, or from the tourist office - which is excellent value, as it gives you unlimited use of the metro/bus, plus free or discounted entries to numerous museums/attractions/restaurants etc. for between 2-5 days.The big dept store El Corte Ingles has a branch right across the road, and lots of other shopping opportunities nearby.If you want to spend all your time in and around Las Ramblas/the beach/old town, then it's not very handy.
