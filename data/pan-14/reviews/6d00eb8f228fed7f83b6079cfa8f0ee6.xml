The hotel is small but so personal and the staff are so friendly helpful without being in your face!! We were given an upgrade on our room plus a bottle of champagne as a token because of being on our honeymoon. room was fabulous, clean comfortable although quite small but it is New York and we were not spending much time in the room. Complimentary breakfast, food and wine was much appreciated and very nice! Free Internet in the lounge was great and always working, yes maybe you have to wait a few minutes but hey not much to quibble about really!! Location could not be any better, literally in Times Square. Fabulous restaurants nearby and always felt very safe. Cannot wait to come back to New York and we will definitly be staying in the Casablanca again. big thank you to John, the manager who gave us great advice on all the sights, restaurants and nightlife! he made us feel so welcome and is a credit to the hotel!
