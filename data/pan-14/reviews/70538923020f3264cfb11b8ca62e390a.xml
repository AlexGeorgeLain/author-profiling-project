Our experience was the same, every member of staff we met was both efficient and VERY helpful. In that respect this must rate as the best hotel ever, anywhere.The but... is not really a criticism of the hotel, it is a warning about Florence. It is a busy city, with narrow streets and lots of people and nightlife. Our room (overlooking the street) was noisy on Friday and Saturday nights, with revellers until around 3:00 am, and then morning noise from about 7:00. Friends staying in other hotels have found the same problems so it is not peculiar to this hotel.Would I return to this hotel ? YES, but I wouldn't chose to stay in Florence over the weekend again.
