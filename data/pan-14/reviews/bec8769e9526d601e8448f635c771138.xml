Stayed for 5 nights in August and thoroughly enjoyed it. Bedroom was a decent size with very good air conditioning and beautifully designed. We upgraded online and I would guess that the cheapest rooms are quite small. Ground floor reception/lounge/bar area excellentRooftop pool area with spectacular views over city. Another (indoor) pool and gym in basementFree internet access Starbucks next door
