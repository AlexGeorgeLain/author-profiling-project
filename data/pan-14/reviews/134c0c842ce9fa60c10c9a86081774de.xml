I remember it being a truely wonderful place, and the private island they have was to die for. The tram ride is also a pretty unique thing. All in all, you could stay here your entire time in Puerto Rico and never leave the resort. However, I would recommend a trip into San Juan (on a tour) at least once, and the jungle tour as well.
