It's an 'older' property, rather traditionally laid out and appointed. The rooms are large, clean, and well appointed. Good towels, many pillows, nice bed.Don't bother with room service; the lobby restaurant serves the same food, a WHOLE lot faster, less cost, calls you when ready, and gives you a nice tray to take upstairs.Computers in lobby for printing boarding passes, printers that WORK, reasonable front desk staff.Parking lot is ample, close to car rental returns and gas stations.Nice place.
