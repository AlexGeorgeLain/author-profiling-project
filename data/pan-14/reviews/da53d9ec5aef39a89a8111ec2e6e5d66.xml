The front desk staff/valet/concierge are very polite and eager to please. We chose this property for the location, outdoor pool and overall reputation of Rosewood. I wished I would've picked a different hotel. First of all, the pool is advertised as being outdoors, but heated so you can swim in it. My children couldn't tolerate it and it felt like it was not heated at all . With temps in the 70's it needed to be. I felt the hotels website was misleading and we wouldn't have stayed there knowing how cold and unswimmable it was. The only time we ate breakfast we felt robbed! I know this is a 5 star property, but our order was messed up, soggy bacon, $6.50 for a cup of coffee and an $80 bill with 2 out of the 4 being from the kids menu. Nothing was exceptional. Three of us got the omelet which was good and I had french toast which was really good, but not that good! Anyway, turn down service was nice, but by 8 o'clock one night we came back to our rooms ready to put the kids down and it hadn't been done. Just a minor thing, but you would think they would know to do it early with a room with children. Also, the bathroom facet was loose and the toilet paper holder was looking as if it needed some TLC. Never did find the ice machine, but I think that is what keep us up part of one night. The doors to the rooms slam shut as well so everytime someone goes in and out you hear it. The coffee and tea are nice in the lobby, but what wouldn't been great is to have a coffee maker in the room! I will end on another positive note, the bottled water at the bedside was very nice.
