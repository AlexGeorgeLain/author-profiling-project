But as mentioned we were slightly disappointed. The largest problem was that the modern room design, with doors chosen for their looks, and not for their sound-insulating capabilities. The result is that privacy on the loo is only possible by turning up the television-volume. The maid not respecting the do-not-disturb light and the complementary shampoo smelling like cleaning detergents were also letdowns. Considering the price of the rooms we can therefore only rate the hotel as average.
