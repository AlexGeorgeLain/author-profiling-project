Great central location near the floating flower markets. Easy access to shops , restaurants, trams etc.The hotel has an impressive lobby and helpful staff . We booked a standard double room as we were only there for 2 nights and didn't see the point of paying the extra 50 euro per night for a luxury room. The rooms were small but big enough for our short stay as we were only in the room a couple of hours as there is so much to do and see in Amsterdam.The only below average thing that I saw whilst staying at the jolly carlton were the grotty looking stairwell that didin't seem to belong to the rest of the hotel at all (as I have a fear of elevators I used the stairs daily, and I'm sure that I was the only guest at the hotel that used them). We opted out of paying for the breakfast as we felt it was very expensive for 20 euro each per day (lovely little cafe around the corner that does a full english for 8 euros each)Amsterdam itself is a lovely city with loads to see and do during the day and night. We pre booked an excursion for the Windmills and Edam tour which was a half day (4 hour) excursion It was a pleasant enough trip but we felt that we were being rushed from one place to the other and not having enough time to browse for souveniers in the the shops. Having arrived in Edam (beware shops are closed on Mondays) we only had 45 mins to have lunch and have a look around. We will definately be visiting Amsterdam again and will again stay at the Jolly Carlton because of the great central location.
