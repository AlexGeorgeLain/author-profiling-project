Someone has rushed in there one morning and decided to turn it Japanese by sticking up murals in each room, replacing dated furniture with trendy minimalism and putting Japanese soap in the bathrooms. It is mostly cosmetic, and underneath it is simply a Best Western, but enough quirky coolness to make for an interesting stay. The rooms are extremely comfy and there are some nice extras like the docking station for an iPod. The sports channels on our TV were faulty and front desk failed to fix it (probably to the relief of my girlfriend) but they were exceptionally friendly so let them off.Location wise, close to a number of bus routes so you can get to different areas like Castro or Downtown with ease. And, it should go without saying, but the perfect place to stay if you want to eat lots and lots of great Japanese food. Especially at the bakery across the road.
