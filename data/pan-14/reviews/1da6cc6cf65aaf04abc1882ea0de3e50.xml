Only complaint would be the small rooms (relative to other hotels of the same class).Unique for the Sydney CBD, the hotel has an outdoor pool which is hardly used, and a very pleasant place to relax after a pie at Harry's.

Was upgraded to a suite on arrival, which was beautifully appointed and (like the rest of the hotel) newly renovated.Staff are plentiful (I'd guess they outnumber the guests by at least 2:1) and serve you in the genuinely pleasant, deferent, instinctive and never-overbearing way which is the hallmark of a top notch hotel.Only complaint (and I'm clutching at straws here) was the price of a beer in the bar, but that's to be expected: wouldn't want a load of drunk backpackers spoiling the atmosphere would we?
