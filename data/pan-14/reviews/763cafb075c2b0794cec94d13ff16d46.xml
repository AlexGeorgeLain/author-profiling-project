The staff, from the concierge to the maid, was welcoming and friendly and always remembered who we were. They were helpful, knowledgable and prompt with our requests, whether they were for ice or directions or retrieving our car from the garage.The cozy bar with complimentary evening wine and good morning coffee was a great place to begin and end our day, and on the weekend there was live jazz to start our evening. The hotel restaurant was intimate and charming, and the food was good and reasonably priced for San Francisco.We were also pleasantly surprised by the rooms and decor. This was not a 'cookie-cutter' hotel. The rooms reminded me of a sophisticated and hip city apartment from the40's or 50's complete with nice art on the walls and a cd player and cd's of San Francisco jazz artists. Our room was small and cozy, the linens crisp and fresh and the bathroom sparkling--a great place to retreat after a day in the city.We were not looking for a 'Four-Seasons' experience, either in price or ambiance. We wanted to experience something unique and memorable in the heart of downtown with easy access to public transit that wouldn't break the bank. The Rex was perfect for us.I have already recommended the Rex to friends traveling to San Francisco in February, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy a creative fingerprint on the hotel world.
