She is helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.The rooms are large, as are the bathrooms - the decor is beautiful. The Residence is in a park like setting, landscaped with fruit trees and an herb garden...if your room looks out to the garden your morning view is peaceful and picturesque. The Residence is a 10 to15 minute walk along the Arno to Ponte Vecchio....be prepared to shop. The major museums, including the Galleria where the David is housed is another 10 minute walk. In the evening the Orologio Trattoria is a good dining spot but if you want a great old Florentine restaurant make sure to check out Trattoria Sostanza on Via Porcellana - blink and you will miss it....a wonderful dining experience.Enjoy the beauty of Florence - the hills, the people, the art and of course the Chianti!
