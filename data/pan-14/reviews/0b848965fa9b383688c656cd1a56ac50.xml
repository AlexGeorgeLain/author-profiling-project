The decor was far from impressive, especially the cheap and tacky bits of chipboard passing for a bathroom cabinet.The robotic hotel reception staff seemed quite unplussed at my dissatisifaction, when I raised the above.The breakfast experience, at the Garden Buffet, was more like attending a food court than a 5 star dining room. Upon arrival the queue to get a table was more like attending the local club (RSL, pokies venue). While the choice of food was impressive and well displayed (and tasty), the sight of bus-boy trolleys clearing tables reminded me of the food court at the local Westfield shopping centre. Plus queuing for the egg station to have an omelete made would have been a novel experience if I could have been bothered.In future, we will be returning to the Wentworth, were the experience is truly 5-star.
