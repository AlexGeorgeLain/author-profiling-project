The room was nice although we did pay a upgrade fee of $75 a night as the room with priceline was only 260 sq feet. There is no coffee maker in room. The television is tiny. No pool. You must call for ice and sometimes it can take over 30 minutes to be delivered. The room service prices are unreal- $18 for a hamburger. Internet service ($10 a night) is from noon to noon. Unlike other places where it is a 24 hour period. Parking will run you $45 a night plus a $6 parking tax fee.For luxury I would say this is not a 4 star hotel such as the Hyatt or Hilton. It felt like a nightclub with a hotel attached. The bar is PACKED most nights and the crowd lingers into the small lobby.I would not stay here again.
