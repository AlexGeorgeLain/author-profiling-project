However, I found the negative comments totally unfounded. Our room was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and very helpful, the parking was hassle free and very reasonable for overnight city parking, and it was an easy 15 minute walk to Fenway. The only down side that I could see is there is no nightlife in the immediate area. The onsite restaurant and bar are both good and the adjacent food court provide a quick and cheap meal option.
