Here is the low down.Food: You will never go hungry! The buffets have a little of something for everyone. The international restaurant has the most delicious lobster. I am not a lobster eater, but I ate the whole thing. The steakhouse was also good. Very american.Rooms: Were nice. Only a few tiny bugs, but they seemed to like the flowers that the maids left everyday. We just threw the flowers away and they weren't a problem at all. For the women who care about their hair, which I do, you will need to buy an adaptor from the giftshop for one dollar. Be warned though, I used my adaptor for 5 days and nearly fried my blowdryer. It actually melted my plug. I recommend only using an adaptor for a few days and then buying a new one. Very cheaply made!Beach: Fabulous! Very clean and large. Better than Mexico. You can go for walks for miles. They say not to reserve the palms on the beach, but we did everyday along with many others. Trips: We booked the Santo Domingo trip through our apple rep and were disappointed. My husband is a history buff so this should have been right up his alley, but NO. A total of 9 hours on a bus for approx a 4 hour tour. Your really rushed through the museums so you dont really get a chance to enjoy at all. Town is bad for beggars. Worse than other caribbean and mexican spots we have been to. It got old real fast. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe. It was good, but nothing to brag about. Don't waste your time or money on this trip.Overall, this vacation was wonderful. I would definately recommend this vacation for a beach lover. And would go back to the Dominacana again.
