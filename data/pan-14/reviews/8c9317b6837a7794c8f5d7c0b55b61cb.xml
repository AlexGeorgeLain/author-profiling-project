The room was spacious and clean the bathroom a good size and the shower excellent, the kitchenette is fit for purpose with a microwave, cooker, coffee machine and toaster along with basic cooking utensils nothing fancy but good enough to cook a meal in. The location of the hotel was excellent in a residential area with 24 hour markets, good restaurants and coffee shops around it. It is also close to the subway so is it is easy as a base to get around from. The staff on the whole were good particularly the housekeeper we had on the weekdays. Overall I would recommend the hotel and happily stay at the hotel again.
