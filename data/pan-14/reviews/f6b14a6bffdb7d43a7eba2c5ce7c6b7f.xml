This hotel is tucked away from the noise and activities of this area, and is on beautiful grounds, with only a road between the hotel and the sea. The road is closed to traffic, so consider it a pathway. There are two pools, and the public areas are very attractive. The service is excellent, and everyone is very obliging. Our ground level room was set in the gardens, in a block of 8 rooms, 4 upstairs and 4 on ground level, with private entrances. There is a small patio attached to each room overlooking the tropical gardens. The room was very comfortable, with a safe, mini bar, TV and a/c. The bathroom had a permanent opening to a teeny atrium, so it is always warm, which I found strange but it was okay. Breakfast was included, and they provided a tastybuffet in the restaurant overlooking the pool. There is a spa but we didn't use it. We went to the Secret Garden Spa in Legian which is excellent and very reasonable. The beach was a disappointment, as it didn't look clean, but it may have been the effects of the tsunami. There are many hawkers on the beach, so we opted to spend our days at the pool, sitting under the palm trees, or even in your own gazebo if you get to the pool early enough. This is not a luxury hotel, but very adequate and good value for your money.
