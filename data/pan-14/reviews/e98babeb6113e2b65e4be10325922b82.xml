Hotel is near Washington University. The rooms are modern, spacious, clean and comfortable. Hotel staff very helpful. Value is excellent. Weekday afternoons happy hour with free beer, wine, etc. Free shuttle service was provided to downtown tour buses and attractions. Lots of free private parking and an excellent security system for accessing room floors. Included breakfast was also better than most.
