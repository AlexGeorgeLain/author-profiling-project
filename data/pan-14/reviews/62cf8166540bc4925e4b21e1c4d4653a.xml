The service was fine and the bar at the top floor was brilliant. Me and my mates quiet happily went for some nice drinks and A*** food most nights. The location was a bit annoyly so only go there if your hiring a car. Vallet parking was efficient and worked well. Pool area was classy and modern, sometimes you seemed a bit too enclosed though. But it's not supposed to be a 2 weeks beach holiday resort. It was great. Not perfect.

The shopping district was a short bus route away. Hop on a tour bus and get a good look at the whole city. It's fantastic. The breakfast was standard, it was a nice change to actually see a hotel in America doing complimentary breakfasts. The rooms were standard and comfortable. Clean and staff were friendly.
