I would advise using the inroom safe.The bathroom is small compared to other US hotel bathrooms I have stayed in. The rooms are kept very tidy witha maid service everyday, linen was cahnged twice during my 3 night stay. The TV was great with 40 TV Channels, mostly US ENglish language howver there was a spanish channel as well as a Japanese channel.Overall this hotel is a great base for the San Francisco tourist as well as business travellers with it's great business facilities.
