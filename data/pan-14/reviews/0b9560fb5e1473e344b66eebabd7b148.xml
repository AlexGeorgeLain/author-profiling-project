We were on the 10th flloor abd the view over Darling Harbour was amazing. Room was very comfortable and the king sized bed a joy to get into especially after our stop over from Singapore. We slept 13 hour solid as the soundproofing was also extremely good. all the staff were very helpful and the doormaneeven managed to hail a taxi for us on New Years Eve to get down to the Rocks. Would definetely stay again.
