We were very pleased with the larger than average room with a comfortable couch and desk. The breakfast cafe was very nice and the buffet breakfast was generous. The room and lobby were clean and nicely decorated and there was a computer everyone could use in the lobby. The location is excellent as you can walk to the area attractions from Ghirardelli Square to Pier 39 very easily. The cable car stop is only a block away. I would recommend this hotel for everyone except people who want luxury or don't like children.
