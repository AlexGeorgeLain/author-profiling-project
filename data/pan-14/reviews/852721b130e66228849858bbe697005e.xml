We booked a luxury king room on the 16th floor. At night you can here the water running down from the upper floors everytime someone used the bathroom. The shower had a temperature lock on it so that you can't turn the water any hotter. There is only one sink with horrible water control. The view was terrible. The pillows were awful. The bed is comfortable. No one so far has mentioned that parking is $50.00 per night with a $45 fee for retrieving your car (in addition). The location is very good and close to most destinations. We did not eat at the hotel but we did eat at Mesa Grill (also average) and Koi (very good). We also saw Wicked (highly recommended).
