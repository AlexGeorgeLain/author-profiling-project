Very nice suites , fully equipped and modern. Staff was great ( taking out a Bently when taxi drivers refused the short trip to The Fairmont Royal York with heavy bags) and location perfect. I later checked in at the Fairmont Royal York for the AIDS conference , but it was not nearly as good as the suites, which suprised me a lot. I would highly recommend this hotel. Also very good price when booking ahead on the internet. Mellgren , Sweden
