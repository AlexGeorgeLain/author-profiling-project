Given that it was around New Years and Hotels were generally expensive my wife and I were extremely happy the location and facilities this Hotel provides.It is approximately 5 minutes walk to both Times Square and Herald Square (Macys) which is ideal for those who are concerned with Shopping.The room was quite spacious for Manhattan and was very clean. The Lobby was small but provided Tea/Coffee facilities and free Internet which was an added bonus.I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to New York, in particular if they are looking to be central while not compromising on the quality of the rooms.All in all a great hotel!
