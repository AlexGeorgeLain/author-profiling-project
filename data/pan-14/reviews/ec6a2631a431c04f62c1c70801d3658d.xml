The room was very dirty and out dated. The first thing I did was pull down the sheets that exposed a rather private type of hair all over the fleece blanket. Then the towels were mostly moth eaten. At my hotel resort, the towels Ramada gave us would have been used to clean tires. Then I was working late when I came back there were people in our room. The front desk clerk gave some acquaintances of ours keys to our room. They should not have stayed there. They were from our area and knew we were staying there so they crashed our hotel room. Thanks front desk guy. Then packing up the next morning there was the most fowl moldy pair of socks I have seen in my life under the bed. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and ask the other people in our room if those were their socks, but we were all in snowboard socks so those used to be white grey green tube socks did not belong to any of us. Poor cleaning, if they cleaned at all. I will continue to warn people. Plus they ran out of parking and key cards so we got one key card to our room and then they just give random people not on the reservation keys to my room. The regular price of my room was 300.00 and because I got it on a discount website the front desk guy made sure we knew and were familiar with the original price of that suite. Awful.
