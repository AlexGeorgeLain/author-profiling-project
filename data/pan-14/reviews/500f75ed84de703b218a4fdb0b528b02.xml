Upon arrival it was late as our flight was delayed there was no where to eat in the hotel but the staff recommended some places nearby to eat and they were very helpfull. The hotel is clean and modern, The rooms are small but furnished nicely with tv and table with 2 chairs and the bathroom is quite large. We must of been upgraded as we seemed to be the only ones with a large balcony which was lovely.This hotel does have building works going on outside on the street, its a little noisy but not too much to cause disruption. This hotel is a good price and close to everything. Would stay here again
