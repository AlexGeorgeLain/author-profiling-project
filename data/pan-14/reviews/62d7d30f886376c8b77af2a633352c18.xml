Our room was very comfortable with a very comfortable bed and clean with an excellent shower in the bathroom. WE dined in the Restaurant (a la carte) and found the service to be a bit hit and miss. The food was very nice but pricey and I wouldn't recommend this if you want a fine dining experience because we had finished our meal within 50 minutes of sitting down.The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful.Breakfast was buffet style and there was a good choice.This is predominantly a conference hotel and not ideal for a family holiday. There is very little to do in the surrounding area as it's a commercial area and the hotel is situated very close to the airport -although you can't hear the planes from inside the hotel.
