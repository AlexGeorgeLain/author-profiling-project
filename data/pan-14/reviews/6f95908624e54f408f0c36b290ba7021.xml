The staff, without exception, could not have been more helpful. In particular, we would like to mention Michalina who on finding out about our special anniversary even brought us heart shaped chocolates!! We stayed on a BB basis and the breakfast could not be faulted and there was a wide variety of dishes to choose from.Our room was large,spotless, it had a King size bed and the bathroom even had a heated floor.Great after a shower! It is 5 minutes walk from Stadtmitte U bahn station-go towards Checkpoint Charlie, then take the 2nd turning on the left. Most places are possible to walk to including the Brandenburg Gate,Tiergarten,Reichstag, Unter Den Linden. Great Italian trattoria(1st right from hotel) fantastic pasta but closed Sundays. When next in Berlin will stay here,central,and great staff. Great hotel,great location
