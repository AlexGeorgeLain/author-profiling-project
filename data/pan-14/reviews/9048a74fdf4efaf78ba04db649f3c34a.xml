The pickup from the airport was ok and very quick and they also took you for free for a 3 mile radius and that included Texas stadium and also to the TRE station. On game day there is a charge for them taking you to the game and back. and this starts 3 hours before the game and upto 2 hours afterwards. (when asked about next year at the new stadium they advised that it is being looked into). They advised that there were renovations going on but was not distubed by them and i left the air con on during the day and didnt need it overnight. Staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellant. There are 30 resurants in the area as well as a couple of gentlemen clubs and a number of asian massage places. You really need a car to get around or a good knowledge of the local transport system. I used the TRE to go downtown and also out to the Stockyards at Fort worth. Beds were comfortable and there was a good supply of different pillows to use. Walls i found were no more thinner then any other hotel.
