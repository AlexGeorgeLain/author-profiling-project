I had read some reviews criticizing the hotel for the carpet, size of rooms, old feel, etc. This isn't the Sheraton and it doesn't charge exorbitant rates. If you want a beautiful fancy hotel, don't stay here and then be unhappy about it. It is what it is. If you are comfortable with modest accomodations, well, this is the place for you.I loved this place as did the rest of the people who I met there. We had an little room with a view of the canal and golf course. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a great job of making sure we had clean towels. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful with their knowledge of the local area. Dennis was fantastic with great directions and information.The parking fees are low for that area and the valet service was excellent. There was one time we had to wait for our car but that was the exception.The pool area is quiet and relaxing. The pool was a bit chilly. The Sand bar was a great little place to relax and the free internet access was excellent. The proximity to the beach, bars, shopping and restaurants was only 2 blocks.This is a great place to stay if you are an economy traveller and don't plan on staying in your room to often.
