It could not have been a more memorable experience. The facilities were great and the entire staff was delightful! We went on an overnight trip to Normandy and when we returned, I felt like I was coming home. Too bad we had only that night left of our memorable trip to Paris.We found several places to eat on the side street Rue Christine and if we needed something else the staff was more than happy to suggest something.We look forward to an excuse to go back to Paris so we can enjoy this hotel again.
