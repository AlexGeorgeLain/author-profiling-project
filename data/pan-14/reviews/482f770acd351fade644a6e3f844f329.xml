We were moved to a side bay view which was much better if a little darker(natural light).This is generally a well appointed hotel in a good location for the major attactions, public transport has good links and the california line tram is right outside the hotel . Price included breakfast which was excellent , great choices and very friendly/helpful staff.The hotel was clean and all the staff seemed friendly. I would recommend this hotel as all round it was very good value, and made an excellent base from which to explore the city and surrounding area.
