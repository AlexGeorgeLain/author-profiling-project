From start to finish we had superb service throughout the hotel. Admitted it's not the cheapest, but I think for Tokyo it represented good value. Very well positioned, with direct access to the metro system, and direct coach link to Narita airport.We had an exective double, (two flat screen tv's!!) 24hr free internet access. The only complaint I can think of is the small size of the bathroom, but the high standard of bathroom toiletries and towels more than made up for it's size. (and the loo seat!! OMG!) I would highly recommend this hotel.

Rooms are small, but at the price represent good value in Hong Kong. We used the restaurant for breakfast on some occasions, we also used the buffet dinner a couple of times.. We had no complaints. I will say a special thank you to ALL members of staff. The service and helpfullness was excellent. We left a couple of bags with the concierge while doing a side trip to Macau. No problems. Also reccomended take a taxi to the airport, pointed out for two people only about more than the hotel bus. Plus the conviance of door to door! (Trip advisor: when you going to add spell checker!!!)
