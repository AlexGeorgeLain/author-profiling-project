While it is an exceeptional deal and in an excellent location, in spite of the recommendations of others, we founf it to clearly not be analagous either to the Riz or to a small Parisian boutigue hotel. Our suite was comfortable and well worht the price but the carpet was a bit stained and worn, and the lobby could have used a bit of brightening--it has gotten just a tad shabby. The rooms on Mass Ave and Commonewealth are inordinately noisey. That siad, for the price it is still a lovely place and very enoyable..parking is $29. a night, so expect a few add-ons. You can't beat the location and the staff is nice--but it is not a mini-version of the Ritz...note even close.
