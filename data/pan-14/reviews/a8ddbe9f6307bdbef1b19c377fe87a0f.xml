The hotel is very nice, clean and the staff is exceptional. Our room had living, full kitchen, king bed and small bath. The balcony overlooked the harbor and we could see the Space Needle through the trees. Hotel was quiet, even though it seemed fairly full of families and business travelers. Morning breakfasts have something for everyone, including eggs, sausage, waffles, pastries, cereals, and several types of breads to toast. Coffee is always available in the lobby. Hotel has a FREE shuttle to both Space Needle and downtown. We used it for drop off and pick up every day and never had a problem. Staff was very helpful and always on time. Desk staff was great at suggesting eating places. We enjoyed outside harbor-view dining with wonderful food at Dukes. (Kid's menu, too) And, the Italian family-style Buca di Beppo is only a couple blocks up the street and an easy walk. We did a seaplane tour with a smaller company (within walking distance) just to the right of Blue Moon Bistro. Also, enjoyed the Argosy tour through the locks - they are located in Union Lake Harbor, as well. We would certainly recommend this as a great place to stay if you are trying to avoid the high cost of downtown hotels.
