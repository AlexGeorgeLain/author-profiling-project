A special thanks to the bartenders, Ruth and Jennifer and to the concierge David. A little overpriced, but it reminded me on so many ways in decor and service the Four Seasons in Istanbul. I will definitely stay at the Ritz when I go back to San Fran.

I booked a smoking room which was a mistake since it smelled like an ashtray. The service at the restaurant was mediocre at best. The only good thing about the hotel was the reception, which was manned by efficient personnel. There are better choices in Manhattan for the same money spent, Millenium by the UN Plaza for example, but that will be said in another review.
