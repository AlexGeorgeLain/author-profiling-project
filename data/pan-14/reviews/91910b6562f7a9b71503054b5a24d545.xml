The only caution I would give is: you must be able to get yourself up one flight of stairs to stay here. Once you've walked up the steps from ground level, there is a small elevator to the Hotel's reception floor. (We loved the spaceship sound it made when the door was open.)The hotel staff was cheerful, friendly, and unfailingly helpful. Andrea is a doll of a concierge and all around hotel representative.The rooms were large, well appointed, and clean. Here again there are a few steps to negotiate whether getting to the room or getting from the bed area to the restroom. Our rooms (the Junior Suite and the River View room had a view of the Arno which is a block away. The rooms were quiet (except for the few times when the church bell outside our window rang calling folks to Mass). Breakfast was predictable (cereal, cheese, meat, yogurt, chocolate/coffee/cappuccino) but more than adequate - the cappuccino comes with a happy face topping it which always reflected our mood while there.The Ponte Vecchio is MAYBE 3 blocks away and everything is within a 5-10 minute walk.I highly recommend the Alessandra.
