It fell out in the taxi and got lost forever. The hotel was really proactive in trying to help me. What else can I say? This hotel is a gem!!!!!! Wonderful, caring staff in an excellent location - very close to two tube stations and finally, a comfortable bed!!!!!!! The room was clean and lovely. The hotel is beautiful and quaint. There's nothing more to say.... I LOVE YOU, PARKCITY! Thank you for an amazing stay!

Though the construction was inconvenient, the hotel staff was wonderful and the hotel was very very nice. The rooms are small but of course, that's a typical European hotel room. The double-paned windows made the noise from the busy street below virtually non-existent. The hotel is literally in one of the best and most convenient areas!!!! The only thing that was hard (literally) was the bed. It was a rock. Other than that, I highly recommend the hotel!
