We had stopped in a couple of times and were able to see a room each time we visited. The staff is the friendliest we've come across in a long time, especially Naomi and Steve. We requested a high floor, ocean front because the view cannot be beaten. It's true, the rooms are small, however, there is a refrigerator and a large closet with a mirrored door. They are tastefully decorated, bright and have been updated with 32 HDTV televisions. It was clean and didn't smell like other reviews had mentioned. The bathroom is also small but there is some exaggeration with regard to the size of the showers, my wife and I managed to both fit quite well at the same time.
