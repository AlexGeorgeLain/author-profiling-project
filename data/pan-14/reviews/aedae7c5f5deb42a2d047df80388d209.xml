Well, it was a GREAT trip- except for the rain the last few days. We were there from Oct.9-13 and even though the hotel was full, it never felt that way. Everyone loved the resort, hubby-hard to please, mom-harder to please :-) and our 2 little girls- 5 and 6. Our 14 year old was a bit bored due to the fact that there weren't many teenagers for her to hang with. Wonder if they have a kids program during peak season? They did show family movies every day at 5:00 p.m. The pool was beautiful, the staff amazingly friendly, beach clean and lovely. I do prefer the Caribbean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean but Intercontinental can't do anything about that. LOL The casino was fun- as mentioned, free food and drinks while gambling. Old San Juan was great shopping and beautiful. Will definitely be back, but beware as hotels everywhere, the food and drink prices were high. Mix BK, Subway,Mi Casita with hotel food and have a WONDERFUL time. We did.
