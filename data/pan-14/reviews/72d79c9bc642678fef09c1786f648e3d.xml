We only stayed 2 nights but would like to stay a week next time. Weather abit cool even for us Brits but go to other side of bridge and its fabulous.We cycled over Golden Gate bridge (about 8 miles), then got ferry back. And u must try clam chowder soup and the fish restaurants on Fishermans Wharf. All in all a fantastic city.Would certainly recommended hotel to all my friends.
