The first impression was that it was all rather basic, but we found as the week progressed we warmed to the hotel. The room was large and clean, it rather noisy being at the front of the building. Staff were helpful and courteous. It is very conveniently situated especially for the highly recommended Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe for breakfast.
