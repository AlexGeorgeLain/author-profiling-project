The staff was friendly and helpful, our room had as good a view as possible from a 4-story building, but the best perk is the location. The proximity to the beach and nice eating places was really convenient (the French cafe a block away was quite good). The complementary breakfast at the courtyard, and Internet, and the cheap parking ($4) were also great. Cons: The room size was okay, it was sunny and painted bright, but the bath was small and cramped. Also, the room rates (we paid $200/night) were a little high in my opinion, given the amenities.Overall: Very positive experience, but a little too expensive. Would definitely consider this next time we're in west LA, but would look around first for some other alternatives as well.
