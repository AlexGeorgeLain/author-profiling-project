Hotel is older but had an updated bathroom that was probably the cleanest I've seen anywhere. Room was a double and small by US standards but average by European standards I guess. We had a balcony room that overlooked Las Ramblas -- if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs, this is not a quiet place and the older door doesn't do much to muffle the street sounds. But if you want a truly fantastic vacation moment (like I did) the noise is worth it just to stand out on your little balcony at night and watch the river of people flowing by below. Really beautiful. Super great location, within walking distance of the cathedral, Barri Gotic, the ports, restaurants, shopping, most of the Gaudi highlights including Casa Battlo, La Pedrera, Palau Guell (although Palau Guell is closed until Dec 06). Even Sagrada Familia is walkable (although a little bit of a hike).Only inconvenience is short flight of stairs from the front door to the check-in(narrow and hard to navigate when dragging baggage) and having to turn in my key to the desk each time I left the room. Staff was VERY kind and helpful, pointing out places to see on the map. There is a younger man that is there most of the time who speaks English and an older gentleman who speaks a little but is very kind and patient with poor Spanish speakers such as myself! There are metro stops really close by if you want to try to get the metro from the airport, other wise a cab ride is 20-25 euro.Great, great location, inexpensive (3 nights for 2 people including a continental breakfast was 210 euro) and clean. Not much else I need!
