We were not disappointed with the Sofitel. Although the city was exceptionally crowded and noisey due to the holiday parades, we found luxurious tranquility from the moment we entered the front door. Every staff person we encountered was friendly, helpful and respectful. They performed their duties impecably without being obtrusive or pushy. The room was very clean with single beds more like doubles. The bedding was immaculate with the look and feel of being brand new. The bathroom was gorgeous with a shower stall the size of many NY bathrooms. The fresh orchid and candle in the bathroom and the thick terry cloth robes and slippers were the extra little touches that made us feel as if we were staying at a European Spa. If you are looking for hi-tech flash and urban splash, the Sofitel is not for you, but if you can appreciate understated elegance and Old World sensibilities, you will not be disappointed with the Sofitel.
