The front desk staff was rude. We arrived early afternoon and were told to hang around until 3:00 when we could get in line to check in. We reserved a king room over the Internet but were given a terribly small queen room with no closet because we didn't book directly through the hotel. The entire visit the lovely courtyard was covered by a filthy, mold-covered tarp, which was what we saw when we left or entered our room, or attempted to look out the window. Housekeeping was virtually nonexistant. After much begging we finally had service after the third day (no towel change, linen change, etc.) I will never stay here again and would definately not recommend this place to anyone. HORRIBLE!!
