The resort was beautiful, the water was great, the food was good, the drinks were better, did well in the casino and the weather cooperated the entire trip. The employees of the resort were also great as well espcieally entertainers Franklin, Francisco, and Ines. David the bartender was also great to us and made the best drinks at the resort. The rooms were clean and were kept that way by the great staff who were always on top of things. However, I do have a couple of small complaints about our trip. Being that I was with a group of 11 I knew that we would not be able to sit together for dinner together every night. However, it wasn't until pulling teeth on the last night that they let us all sit together. I would not recommend this resort for anyone going in a group over 6 people as they are not willing to accomidate that size group for dinner. Room service often took over an hour for food which at times was exactly what we were trying to avoid by having to wait for breakfast or dinner or just spend some alone time together with my wife. Also, on several occasions the food we ordered pool side never showed up or took hours to be brought to us. The pool side drinks were never in short supply and Jocasta did a great job of keeping us hydrated. Last but not least, the soft serve ice cream machine either being broken or only having one flavor was a little annoying. Even thought this is a small thing, it was one of the things I was really looking forward to on the trip and it was a little disappointing. Overall, it was great trip with great friends and I would recommend this resort to others who are looking for a getaway.
