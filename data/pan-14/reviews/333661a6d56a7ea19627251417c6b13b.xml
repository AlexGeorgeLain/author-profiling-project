When I tried to check in they had given my room away and I had to pay an upgrade charge to get a room similar to the one I booked weeks ago.The staff at the front desk in snooty, much of the rest of the staff are not nice.I was forced to stay here because my business meeting was here, I will consider commuting from another hotel if I have to return.
