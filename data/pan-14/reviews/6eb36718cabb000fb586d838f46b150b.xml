I am a returning guest of the hotel because of its excellent services. The staff, especially the guys at the front desk, particularly Mike and Isao are two of their best people. As an administrator who has been traveling since 1974, I have had my share of hotels and motels during my many years of travel. I have stayed at five or six stars and I have also stayed at lesser expensive hotels such as Motel 6. To me, it is not so much that a hotel has to offer in terms of its amenities, but rather the services the hotel and its staff provides. Over the last three consecutive years of my travel through or to Honolulu, I have always asked to stay at this hotel simply because of the excellent services that its staff are providing the guests. To me Mike and Isao are the people who makes this hotel a six star in terms of its excellent services. I am planning to continue to stay at this hotel all of my future travel to Hawaii.Keep up the excellent work, Mike and Isao, and I hope to see you soon.With warmest and gratified Aloha,Yoichi K.
