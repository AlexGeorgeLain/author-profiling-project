Elevator was not working when we arrived so had to carry our bags up 4 flights of stairs. Checked in on the 4th floor but our room was actually on the third floor through another locked door saying Hotel Toledano. The room was half painted and half plastered and smelt of damp or wet paint or something. The room was quiet as it was at the back of the building away from the street but you can hear people in the other rooms. The bathroom was very dated and I didn't like to touch the shower curtain. On reflection, I don't think there was really any difference between the hotel and hostal rooms. We paid 70 euros per night which seems expensive for the standard of accomodation. There is free internet which is good but I wouldn't stay here again.
