A word of advice don't keep your window open at night because in the morning you'll hear the duck tour. Other than that an awesome hotel with friendly staff.

At first I was checked into a room that smelled like cigarettes and cheap perfume.Next to the room number was a no smoking sign. I called down to the front desk to switch rooms and they told me the hotel didn't do that and I was staying on the smoking floor. So I tried to air out the rancid room but the window would fall down whenever you opened it. SO.... I finally went down to the front desk to tell them the room was unacceptable and they told me to call expedia and try to get a refund. I did and expedia told me to make sure the hotel manager wouldn't foot the bill. At this point the front desk was tired of seeing me and gave me a better room.... 2 hours later. In the morning a false fire alarm went off and I was forced to stand outside for an hour I then asked for a late checkout and they said get out by noon. So needless to say the wost hotel.
