Shared a room on the 58th floor with views over the harbour which were fantastic.The rooms were spacious with 2 queen size beds. Having the Lavazza coffee machine in the room was great. We started our mornings with a coffee sitting on our beds gazing out at the harbour. So relaxing! The breakfast in the Executive Lounge was good. The service in the hotel was great. My friend lost her credit card in an ATM in the Raffles City shopping complex and the staff member in the Executive Lounge was so helpful in helping her with phone calls etc and she managed to get her card back the next day. Normally, sorting out issues like that is a nightmare.The location is great. Just above the Raffles City MRT (making it so easy to get everywhere) and the Raffles City shopping complex. Loads of great inexpensive food places in the market place at the bottom of Raffles City as well as a great supermarket.The pool area was lovely as well.We'll definitely be back for another girlie weekend as well as bring the family here. It is also an ideal place to have a family break.
