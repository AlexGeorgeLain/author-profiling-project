This is fine - it makes for an interesting stay in an interesting part of Sydney, with great eating options just outside your door.The room was nice, done in shades of chocolate brown, including the carpet, however this means every bit of lint shows up and it's very easy to see if the room has been vacuumed after it's been serviced in the morning.I agree with a previous reviewer that:- The aircon is noisy. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the white noise helps cover the noises from the street (esp. on a Saturday night :)- The bathrooms are not really anything special, but generally fine.- You can certainly hear the neighbouring room guests if they are chatty.I essentially enjoyed our stay in Kings Cross (3 nights) and the room was superficially very nice (including widescreen LCD TV, albeit the picture was stretched as it didn't have a digital box), however I can state that around $10 in small change went missing from the room, and despite reporting this to reception and having them promptly check the electronic door lock to see whom had been there last, we had no resolution, and not even a follow up call.Granted there is a safe in the room, and you can be sure we kept all our valuables in in after that, however you would think some small change scattered across the desktop would still be safe in a hotel such as this. Very disappointing.
