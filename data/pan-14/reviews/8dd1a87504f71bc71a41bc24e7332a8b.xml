The other reivews have covered the basics., the hotel is well placed for access to transport, the concierge is excellent and the staff in general are helpful and efficient. The hotel is well priced for what it is and the pool was delightful. The beds however were another story, they had to be the hardest I have experienced in a very long time, so hard that sleeping was very uncomfortable and in future would put me off staying here. SInce my stay I have been told that this is typical of hotels in Asian countries howver this is not my experience and the marriott in Singapore,, which I stayed at on a previous trip and although substantially more $ to me would have been a better buy for the better sleep. Sorry guys., your hotel is great, but your beds suck, I hope you can do something about them.
