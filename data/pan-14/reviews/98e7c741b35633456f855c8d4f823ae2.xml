We asked for an upgrade for the birthday boy and they gave us a Suite for no extra cost. The staff was really friendly, starting with the lady at the front desk and throughout the rest of the property. The rooms were nice and well kept, the beach was the cleanest of all the beach spots around. I liked the Casino at the El San Juan better than the IC but the dealers were friendlier at the IC. In all we had a great time and will def return for another stay. Tip...the El San Juan next door has a really nice nightclub, get there early on a Sat night and they have a cool roof top bar as well.
