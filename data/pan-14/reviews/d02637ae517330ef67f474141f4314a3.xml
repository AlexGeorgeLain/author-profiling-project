We stayed at the Travelodge Wynyard for 4 nights.Really is a 'value for money' hotel.The location is so perfect ,being 10 minutes from Darling Harbour and 15 from The Rocks. As its practically next door to Wynyard Staion it makes it easy to travel to destinations further afield.

We have stayed in some good hotels but for convenience (re travel) this is definitely the best. Literally 3 minutes from Shinjuku station it is perfect for getting quickly to anywhere in Tokyo. We got the Narita Express from the airport and found getting to the hotel very easy.Make sure you exit at the correct exit from the station ( South Terrace Exit) as with it being such a huge station you can easily get disorientated.. A young mn on Flikr has done all the work for you so if you click on his link then he spells out exactly how to get to the hotel !http://www.flickr.com/photos/71736073@N00/221222443/The staff are friendly and very helpful. There was a good selection of food at breakfast ( when I asked for a fried egg a member of staff brought me one to the table !). We had dinner twice ( in Tribeks) and thought the meals were very good.Shop around for a good deal ( I booked with Asiarooms which was a lot cheaper than the other sites and breakfast was included). The cheapest flights were with Finnair.Will almost certainly stay at this hotel again when we visit next Xmas.
