We stayed at the suite tower floor was 17 I believe, beautiful views of the beach and the mountain. It was a nice experience nothing special. The hotel was across the street from the beach which became a hassle if you wanted to go there, but it was doable. The concierge staff was outstanding we did so many activities through his suggestions. All in all it was a nice hotel nothing fancy, nothing horrible about it, they did have a great breakfast buffet though, which I suggest but might be pricey. It's an above average hotel from our tower, but I heard the tower in the back is more like a 2 star.
