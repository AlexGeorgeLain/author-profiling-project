The location is excellent; quiet street with the U-bahn entrance just 50 metres away (two stops from Alexanderplatz hub). Staff were genuinely friendly. Basic room was quite small and the bed was a sprung matress - very uncomfortable - far too soft. There was a helpful warning about mosquitoes by the window though and as they tend to be fond of my blood this was a handy tip.So.... breakfast 8/10, location 8/10, bed 1/10 - my poor neck!
