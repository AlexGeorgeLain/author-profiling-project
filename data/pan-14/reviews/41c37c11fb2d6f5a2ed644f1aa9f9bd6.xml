The hotel it self is a cozy one, not overly decorated and with just enough amenties to keep you happy. Located right on Ala Moana Blvd., it is conveniently located close to Waikiki, Ala Moana Center and other attractions. Our only concerns were the one elevator, the on-site off site parking, located at the Aqua Waikiki Marina (just behind The Equus), and the hum of traffic that somehow filtered through the sliding glass doors (we were on the 5th floor. Other than that, the staff was very friendly and courteous, especially at the the Front desk, and the rooms were very clean and very cozy. I would definitely do a return visit.
