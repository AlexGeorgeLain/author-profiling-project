Staff in all areas of the hotel were very friendly and accommodating. Hotel has a no tipping policy which is nice. Rooms were clean and comfortable but I'd book a higher floor room and make certain it's not on the World Trade Center side of the hotel as these rooms tend to be darker. Easy access to and from Logan either by cab $25 or subway $5.
