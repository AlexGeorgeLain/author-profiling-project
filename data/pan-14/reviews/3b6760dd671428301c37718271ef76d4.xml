Close to everything (Near Gran Via metro). The decor is very minimalist and trendy. The room was much more minimalist than I would choose for my own home, but was fun for a vacation.Service was friendly and helpful.I had read negative comments on street noise (the down side of a great location) -- however our room was on the back so this was not a problem.As a gay visitor, a great advantage was that it's steps from the bustling Chueca district with most of the gay bars and clubs.

Luckily, since location was one of our prime decision points, the Avenida Palace was one block away on the Gran Via de Catalunya.It's a very old-school hotel. Lots of rosewood and plush. Unfortunately, it appears to have seen better days. Things are a bit tatty and worn.Service was wonderful. No compaints.The itnernet connection was a bit problematic. They had an expensive 2-tiered plan. The cheaper one (11 euros/day?) had limited capacity and services. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my experience in the states, where it is often free -- but in this case, I paid more for less.
