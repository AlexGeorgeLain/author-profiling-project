When we had an issue, the response was as good as it could be. The decor is beautiful. Our room (636) was extremely well appointed. The location of the hotel couldn't have been better. The restaurant was well run with good food. This is the only hotel we have found that PRINTS the paper of your choice.If we were to return to Barcelona we would definitely stay again at the hotel.
