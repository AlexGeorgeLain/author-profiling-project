I booked my sister and brother-in-law in for 3 nights(and was with them whenever they were in the room, except at night) in late September, 2004; and unfortunately, the weather was hotter and more humid than usual. The room had an excellent view(#1010-a corner room) of the beach, the park, and Diamond Head. The location is excellent...away from the busiest part of Waikiki, and less than a block from the beach. On the negative side was the air-conditioner. Despite the AC unit being replaced 3 times by new units, it never gave out enough air to cool the room, which I thought was very odd. We closed all the windows, but still no luck. There are lots of windows to open, but with it being so hot, with not much in the way of tradewinds, it was unbareable. They didn't have any fans, which would have helped somewhat. Also, the bed was not comfortable...when you laid on one side, the other side lifted up! All the staff(maintenance, housekeeping, bell desk, etc.)seemed very nice and helpful; but I think the front desk/reception could do with a bit more of the aloha that Hawai'i is known for. I will say the manager was friendly and professional, but wasn't able to correct the AC problem. The pool area was nice and on the 3rd floor...above the street noise. The price was certainly right(found it on-line), but if you don't like being awaken early by the birds, I'd try to find another place(it's right across from the zoo)!
