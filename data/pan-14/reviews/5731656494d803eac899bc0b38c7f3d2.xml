We booked the hotel directly and got 2 rooms for the 6 of us. The location is perfect if you are arriving by train! The hotel was absolutely wonderful in every way. It was full of personality and charm and the staff was fantastic. They we were wonderful with our children and gave us great recommendations on restaurants. We celebrated a birthday there and it could not have been nicer. We travel quite a bit and would highly recommend this hotel for its personal service,location,lovely atmosphere and staff, and their kindness towards our children. We would love to go back!
