We used Holiday Inn rewards points for our stay. The hotel is close to a beach, but much of the beach area is a rocky shore. The taxi ride from the airport to the hotel was $19.50 and the taxi ride to the airport with 6 large bags was $25. The taxi to Old San Juan was $12. Don't miss the forts!The room was nice and clean. The only downside to this hotel was that checking in and out was unbelievably slow! The computers w/ internet free of use was nice and the small pool and hot tub were not crowded. Continental breakfast was good, just like any holiday inn express, except no cinnamon rolls. Having a Walgreen's 3 blocks away was nice and there were some good restaurants in that same area. Overall a good place to stay.
