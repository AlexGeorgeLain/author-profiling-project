Just returned from a night in Florence at the Una Hotel Vittoria and i definitely loved this hip boutique hotel. I found a very convenient price at Una website (just 170 Euros for an Executive room which regular price is 490, better than any other website) and immediately booked a room for me and my boyfriend. Una Vittoria is a trendy and modern hotel located in San Frediano, a typical florentine neighborhood, at just 15 min walk from Ponte Vecchio. Our room (number 109) was large, clean and really comfortable, and the bathroom was huge (loved the deepest thub i've ever seen!!).. plasma screen in front of the bed and a little flat tv in the bathroom give a stylish touch to this incredible room! Frette lines are awesome and you'll love the little lights in the leather-covered walls all around you, it makes you feel like sorrounded by the stars! The staff is very friendly and useful, the decor of the hotel is hip and funny. Restaurant and bar are very trendy and the food really good. Interior parking. Great breakfast included. Highly recommended, but avoid it if you're looking for a more typical and classical hotel (and you're not into those design hotels), and if you want to be closer to the major attractions of Florence.
