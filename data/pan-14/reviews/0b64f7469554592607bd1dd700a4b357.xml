We were in a non smoking building, next to the swimming pool and close to the beach and beach restaurant.We enjoyed the professional band playing most of the nights. We made sure that we were there from 8pm to 8.30 pm. They played ballroom dancing for half an hour, rumba, chacha,. They even played a foxtrot and a tango for us.After 45 minutes of children animation, the band come back and play 45 minutes of social dancing, meringue, salsa, bachata, etcThe shows are very good.

All the blocks are close to the pool, beach and buffet restaurant.The service was very good. The grounds are well kept.We ate most of the time at the main buffet restaurant at the Punta Cana or the Palace. We had lunch most of the time the Beach restaurant , with a good selection of food, and a nice breeze.The main Buffet restaurants where air conditioned and non smoking.The food was excellent.The shows at night in the theater were good if you can stand the smoking or second hand smoke.In the Lobby of the Palace they had different bands at night, but heavy smoking was our main concern. They should have separated areas for the non smokers. Ashtrays were on every table.The beach was beautiful. We swam in the ocean a few times, but the weaves were quite strong. The staff was very courteous and professional. It was a beautiful place. We enjoy the Dominican music in the lobby, bachata, meringue or ballladas.
