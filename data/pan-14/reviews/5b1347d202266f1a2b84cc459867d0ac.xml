However, they also put the place into perspective and lowered any expectations. The place is basic, though in quite a good location. Forget what they refer to as the complimentary breakfast as it is weak coffee in a paper cup and a dried out sweet roll. The rooms are aged, though seemingly clean and the TV and a/c worked fine. Previous comments re reception staff are generally correct (they aren't much help at all), apart rom the night manager (on the desk after midnight), who was useful. Given the price (ie if well under USD 100/nite) then it's not a bad option for a sleep and short d'town Miami visit.
