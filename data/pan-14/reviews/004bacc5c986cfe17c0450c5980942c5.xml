The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Miss Wendy will accomodate your requests without hesitation. Also the valets will get your car at any time without delay. The rooms are clean but could use some updating of the furniture and bathrooms. If you have loud neighbors that come in late you will definitely hear them. I was traveling on business by myself and really did not think the neighborhood was too safe at night to be out alone. But if you have some other people with you I don't think that you would have any problems with the location of the hotel. This hotel is for someone that wants to experience a quaint hotel and is not expecting the Four Seasons.
