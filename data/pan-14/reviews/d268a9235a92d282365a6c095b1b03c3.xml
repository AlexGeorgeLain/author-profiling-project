This is a really nice hotel, classic design with a fantastic decor throughout. The room I was in was large, well decorated with a nice on-suite bathroom - it had all the conveniences I needed. The location is nice - not far from a metro station and with quite a few restaurants near by. The resturant in the hotel was really nice, they serve a great breakfast selection and the mediterranean food I had one evening was good too. The staff at the hotel were really good.
