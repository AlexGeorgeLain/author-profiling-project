The hotel is in a quiet, leafy street, between 8th and 9th avenue. While it is in a quiet area, you are no distance away from the sights of New York - it is a great base.Our room was upstairs. While it was small, it was adequate. The tv was modern, with many channels. The bed was very comfortable, and we were very glad to have an air conditioned room. The toilets were across the hall, and were always available.The only draw back was the shower in the room. There was no 'drying' area - so once you stepped out of the shower you were standing in the bedroom.Overall, I would recommend Chelsea Lodge to anyone wanting a cheap, but very clean and charming hotel.
