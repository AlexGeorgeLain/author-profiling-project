Two nights here on 16th - 18th November out of Newcastle ... on recommendation from TripAdvisor reviews (of course...) Easy to find thanks to directions on this site Airport bus to Plaza de Catalunya (you can pay on bus .. the ticket machine next to the stop at the airport Terminal 1 didn't take our banknotes, and there's no English help here ..Facing the Corte Ingles store, go left 2.5 blocks to the BIG road Gran Via, and then go right two blocks .. look for the red flag hanging above the doorway .. ring the bell, go through the small door into the entrance, turn the light on the wall to the r!ight and up the stairs to reception where a friendly smile and your keys to your room await you.We usually stay modern, this was like stepping back in time and in high society .. there were antiques everywhere, grand cabinets, tall ceilings, beautiful objects and antiques mixed with hi-tech plasma tv in the small lounge and fascinating things laid out on hall tables. Amazing.We stayed in Romm 101, my sister and her husband in room 104.101 was cute, small, comfortable, with lovely low slung beds with huge fancy headboards complementing the tall mirrored wardrobe , and the small balcony overlooking La Gran Via (road) .... the traffic was pretty constant apart from Sunday morning, but if you close the shutters, then the door and the curtains, we slept very well indeed, with an occasional background hum or police siren.Bathroom is tiny, modern and clean with a toilet and shower only and there's a small LCD television and CD player on the wall of the bedroom.We found the matress comfortable indeed and both slept very well each evening, though we had eaten like kings close by during the afternoon and the evening with a few few glasses of wine or beer which may have helped. Room 104 is definitely bigger and brighter as it empties onto the communal (shared by four aprtments / rooms of the Hostel)We will return!
