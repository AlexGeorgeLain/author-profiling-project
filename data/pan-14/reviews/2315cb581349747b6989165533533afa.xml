I was traveling by myself and I was given a two single bed room, I asked if they could change it for a one bed room and they told me that they couldn't change the category of the room, I replied that it wasn't a change of the category but a change of beds and they told me that they would try but it would be difficult; of course I didn't have my room changed. There were broken things in the bathroom too like a hanger.On the other side, cleanliness is not good either. I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in a row and they didn't change sheets during my whole stay (inacceptable for a hotel that claims to be 5 stars). Breakfast is good and plenty of choice but the service once again left a lot to be desired; the rest of the people were escorted to the tables and served coffee and freshly squezzed orange juice, I had to order it several times. All in all I would give this hotel 3 star; the only good thing about it is its location.
