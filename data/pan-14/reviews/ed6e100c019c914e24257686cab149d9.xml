We were allowed to check in early, and found our room to be spacious and beautiful. The place was spotlessly clean and the bed was huge. The showers had great water pressure, which seems to be rare even in really nice hotels. The staff couldn't have been nicer- they had a bottle of champagne and box of chocolates sent to our room as an anniversary gift! The neighborhood- well, it's pretty mixed, but hey, so is most of downtown SF! It's busy and lively enough that we never felt unsafe- there are just too many theatergoers around, and the doorman was always vigilant. There's a Walgreens right across the street for any last-minute needs, and taxis drive by fairly often. You're within walking distance of Union Square and the major shopping areas, as well as cable cars and tons of great restaurants and bars.This is the nicest of the Kimpton hotels we've stayed at- it has the usual Kimpton friendliness with a bit nicer decor and amenities.
