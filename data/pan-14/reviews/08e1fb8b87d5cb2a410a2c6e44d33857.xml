Always for buisness. I usually only stay at Westins if I can.Great service matters. Quiet clean rooms matter. Nice beds and quietness matters.If all of this matters to you, then 41 Hotel is the right place for you.I had a wonderfull 3 day stay. They have complimentary food around the clock available. Honor bar in lounge and staff to attend your every need. Free internet.More like staying at a good friends house.I will be back when I return to London.

I have stayed at several and though the SF version is nice, I don't think it measures up to W standards.Pricey, so so location and SMALL rooms. A little dirty and compared to other W's, awkward.

Although the prices for other stuff....food etc is high, the location coupled with the quietness and quality make this hotel the top. Close to the BART, in Union Square, on the Trolley line. Great Place.
