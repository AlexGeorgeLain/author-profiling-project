This hotel has not been reviewed for quite sometime and must have changed a great deal recently.We stayed in room 403, which had a bad review last year, the room was a little on the small side but had been decorated recently to a very high standard and was kept spotlessly clean by the housekeeping team.The hotel is still undergoing refurbishment but that didn't cause us any problems.The staff at reception were very helpful with directions and very helpful when asked for advice.We did not have breakfast there so can't comment on that.The bar was closed for refurbishment but there is nice bar/restraunt over the road.It is probably in one of the best locations in the city.Overall we had a great time there and wouldn't hesitate in recommending it.
