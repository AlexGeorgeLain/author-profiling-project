At the back so overlooked the old walls but fine.Good bathroom.Quiet, certainly not bothered by the train noise. Superb location, didn't take B'fast so can't comment. My only criticism is that the aircon only works in the summer; during the winter months it's actually the heating system so the room was too hot! even when switched off. We opened the window but would imagine this might be a problem for rooms at the front because it is a very busy road. Good value if you get a special deal but not if you have to pay full price.
