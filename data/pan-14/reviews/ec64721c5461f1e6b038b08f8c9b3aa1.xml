You get more then what you pay for, the price was great since it included a delicious Cook to order breakfast every morning a Happy Hour everyday from 5:30-7:30 all you can drink plus free snacks. The bartenders were great! Friendly. Those are just a few things that saved us a whole lot $$. The rooms were Spacious clean! a nice wet bar, a separate living area and great staff! The pool was just beautiful! And relaxing. The casino was a bit small but comfortable and every night they raffle gifts prizes. I won a $50 raffling prize! This hotel was only a block 1/2 from the beach and just steps away to all restaurants, Hotels Night Life. The front desk was very helpful with directions etc. The gym room came in handy, and so did the laundry room. There was an Outback Steakhouse in the Hotel the food was great and the prices were reasonable. A small convenience store was great for snacks, cigarettes, last minute things. The Lobby was just beautifully decorated with Palm trees and ponds, it was just so! Worth it.. We stayed for 4 days but wished we were there longer! Now where are you going to find a great deal like this??? At the Embassy Suites!!There was a small restaurant Mi Casita just in the plaza 1blk away with Great! Spanish food for a great price. Also there was an Edith's Cafe right across from the Hampton Inn Suites on Isla Verde Ave with Delicious food and reasonable prices. Lupis, was a nice place to hear music have a couple drinks good food as well. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends family!
