The hotel has been refurbished recently (so everything is new) but the hotel lifts are probably its charm. It functions well but the way you have to run around [each lift has doors facing in a different direction]. Rooms are clean and equipped with LCD TVs. Broadband is available but expensive. There are computers in the lobby too that you can use (also chargeable). Note that the corridors outside the rooms are narrow. And I mean, really narrow. Two persons could not pass each other without one stopping! But once inside the room, it's ok. Some rooms have horrible views so if you plan to stay in to work/rest, ask for rooms that face Riley St (you can a view of the city). Occasionally if the tourist buses show up, the breakfast downstairs is a bit of a rush. But if you are willing to walk about 3 minutes onto Oxford St, you can get any kind of breakfast you want. For the price it charges, it's got the most horrible car park facility in the world - using it is an experience itself you will not forget.
