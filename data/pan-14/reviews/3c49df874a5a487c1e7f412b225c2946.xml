We have been there around 5 or 6 times so far and apart from the first time, have found every subsequent visit quite disappointing to start with.We always request a non-smoking room with 1 king or queen bed, on a high floor and usually pay for a harbour view room. However, on almost all of our stays, we get told that either there are no non-smoking rooms left or no rooms with 1 bed. This is despite reservations being made months in advance. On a couple of occasions the rooms have been extremely 'tired' with old and stained furniture. After complaining, we usually get moved to another room - however, this is not the best way to start your holiday. When hotels take your booking and requests they should make sure they allocate you the appropriate room that you pay for when you arrive. Having said that, we do like the large rooms of the Stamford, the location, balconies and the breakfast that is usually included! Yes we would stay there again - but we always check in with bated breath hoping that we get the proper room and amenities that we book and not have to move around from room to room.
