We (a family of four) have just returned from a week at the Sheraton Waikiki and was disappointed. The hotel has a great location and good staff, but it currently has so many little issues that make it not worth the stay. First, it is crowded and it can take upto 15 minutes just to get an elevator to the lobby. They have only one tiny pool facing the ocean due to renovations at the sister hotel next door. Forget about getting a chair! They also have no covered or grass space also because of the situation.They do have a nice beach down the way with a place to get a chair if you show your room key, so kudos to them for that, but NO umbrellas, so you just bake. No food or water available. They also do have a nightly show that was fun. Food selection was good and prices were $$, but that was to be expected. We also did have a small mini fridge in the room, but no desk to work at. Room TV was newer flat screen and medium sized.We caught the maid washing out the room coffee pot and glasses in our sink. I thought 60 minutes was joking about this practice! Needless to say we didn't use them again. Also, the room alarm clock didn't work.Overall I would say this is not the best hotel for the money except for location, but then again, there are many hotels on Waikiki.

I was there on business and found the staff to be nice, the rooms clean and big, and free breakfast good. Hotel has very small gift shop. It is a little tricky to get to from the airport.
