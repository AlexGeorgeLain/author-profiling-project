I was originally booked into another hotel in Venice but due to flood repairs they called to cancel us and I was very dissapointed. This was a suprise holiday for my then girlfriend, it was her birthday and she had always wanted to go to Italy. So right up to the day it was a suprise where we were going.The hotel was so magical, so much so that before we had even checked our bags in I took her out to the balcony and proposed to her (I had planned on doing it at some stage during our 3 days there but the view from the balcony was perfect!) she said yes and we were married 2 and a half weeks ago.We hope to come back for one of our anniversaries. The staff were lovely and the room - just at the top of the stairs to the right as you walk towards the balcony - was perfect!I can highly reccomend this place and it will always hold a special place in our hearts.
