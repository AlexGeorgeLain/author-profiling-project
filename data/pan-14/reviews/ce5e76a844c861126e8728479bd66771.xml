The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The rooms are nicely furnished with good quality fittings throughout including a desk and minibar. They are also quite roomy for a European hotel. The hotel advertises that all rooms have WiFi but not stated is that it is very expensive at $116 per week and not very fast. The buffet breakfast was very good with a nice selection of items. Location was excellent with easy walking to the Metro and two shopping areas. I would definitely consider staying here again.
