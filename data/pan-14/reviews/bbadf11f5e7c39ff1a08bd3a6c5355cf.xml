My partner and I stayed at the Wind Chimes Inn for seven nights at Christmas time and really loved the hotel, for many reasons. The hotel staff was warm and friendly, room small but most comfortable, food and drink at the hotel bar restaurant excellent, location terrific in hip and walkable Condado. There are many great features to the hotel, including a great pool, location, hours and laundry service (for $10 you leave your clothes in a heap and return to find them clean and folded neatly). We would highly recommend the hotel. Excellent value!

The hotel is fairly well located, within 10 blocks to the Muni and Union Square. The location, however, also is in the midst of a lot of SRO hotels with homeless and strays, but they presented no real problems. The hotel was very comfortable and the room enjoyable, and an excellent price of $99/night (king room) in SFO. The hotel has a good restaurant, Mel's Diner (from LA) which is open nearly all night. We took the BART from SFO and exited at Civic Center, and didn't mind the walk to the hotel (go west 3 blocks to Van Ness and then turn right for 8-10 blocks), a better deal at $4.95/person versus shuttles. The BART plus walking took about an hour.Hotel staff very nice, room comfortable, breakfast good (although crowded and a bit chaotic) and overall a very pleasant stay.
