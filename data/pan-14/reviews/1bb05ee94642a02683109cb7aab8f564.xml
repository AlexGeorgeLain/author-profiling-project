Make sure to read all the bad reports on this hotel,they are all true!Myself and 3 others have just returned from our dreadful experience at this 2 star hotel on legian beach.We actually sat down and tried to work out how we would rate this hotel,I can tell you it was very difficult to even give it 2 stars How on earth it is rated 9 out of 23 for popularity ;beats me.And it is time that whoever does the grading of theses hotels took another look at this one(to let people know what exactly they are getting for their money)My family and I have been going to Bali since the 1980'sStaying in different hotels has always been part of the fun ,of the holiday...UNTIL NOW!From the beach this hotel looks lovely,the pools and grounds look lovely,the restaurant looks lovelyBut thats enough,take our's and others advise and don't stay hereWe stayed in the main block at the rear of the hotel,on the 3rd floor, at the front overlooking a large noisy driveway!The back rooms didn't even have this .The rooms at the back of the building faced a 3 or 4 storey high cement grey wall which produced a dark cold corridor,with musty unpleasant air about it.Our front room had no hot water the week we spent there,Luckily between us all we had different rooms so we used their shower each day which was a real inconvenienceComplaining to the front desk,and then to customer service did no good ,and were told the problem had been fixed!we gave up in the end!the floor in both rooms was never cleaned ,without shoes on our feet were black.there was never even enough hot or wam water for a decent wash,and at times the cold water did not work at allThe room was always full of mozzies,the toilet didn't flush properlystaff were not friendly at the foyer or restaurantIf you have to stay here your best bet would be to choose a deluxbungalow near the pool,front row try 0a/0b or oc cottagewe looked at these very nice! and you would not have the problems we had.(hopefully)The pools were clean,and the spa great fun!Just don't book in to the superior rooms with uneven numbers in the main buildingcheers trisha
