We arrived quite late on a Thursday evening (9:30pm Pacific) due to our flight from Atlanta. We had booked online and I had asked for an upper level no-smoking room. There was no availability for either unfortunately I was told and initially we were placed in a smoking-permitted floor and room. I called the front-desk to ask if any accomodation could be made. The night manager, a wonderful person named Ellen K., indicated she would have us moved to another deluxe room that was non-smoking if we didn't mind moving to another room on our third day/night's stay. This was fine with us. Ellen subsequently called back a few minutes later and said the third night would be an upgraded deluxe suite room on an upper floor because of the trouble (at no extra charge of course). The entire stay was extremely nice, the BellHop area held an extra bag for us for three days while we went to Big Sur in a Miata and provided the bag as needed. Overall a great customer service environment. And the rooms/beds/furnishing was top-notch. The only possible knock is that the hotel is in the financial district. The night-life areas, such as Union Square and North Beach, are within a few blocks walking distance so this is a minor point-of-note. Don't wear heels like my wife did though.
