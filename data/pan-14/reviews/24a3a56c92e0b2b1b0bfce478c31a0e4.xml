This hotel was located basically across the street from the train station in Florence which made it extremely convenient for us as we were arriving by train. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's updated decor (seemed to have been recently renovated) and the rooms were a clean, albeit a bit spartan. Our room was quite large and faced the side of the hotel, which made it extremely quiet. The room had air condition (thank goodness, since it was insanely hot outside), which I guess can be a rarity in the area. A few major positives for me were the free breakfast which was included as well as free Internet access (both wireless and workstations were provide) - we have stayed at quite a few hotels in Europe and Internet access is defintly hard to come by (especially free access), which made this big plus. All in all, a great hotel which was very conveniently located in the heart of Florence.
