Had booked this hotel for a 10-night stay (got a great deal via HotelConnect) mainly based on the many great reviews here.And it fully lived up to our expectations!Check-in a bit late - but it was a busy time for the hotel, and there's plenty to do just on the doorstep, so that was okay!Great location - plenty to see, and good train/tube connections. Charing Cross only 10 mins by train. Even Portobello - which is in the direct opposite of London - only took less than hour by tube.Staff was friendly and hard-working - yes, many are from other European countries, but all work hard and are very friendly, so I can't see why some reviewers (and even some hotel-guests we overheard) would mention it as if it was a negative!Beds comfy, room spotless, good sanitary appliances as opposed to usual British plumbing! Nice tub. Fluffy towels. Miller-Harris smellies.Breakfast was typical hotel fare, not especially exciting, but fresh, varied and plentiful.Room-service fast and delicious, great selection of food.Ate dinner at Georgetown - highly recommended! There are plenty of places to eat in the area around the hotel (try the baguette-sandwiches from Patisserie Paul in the tube-vaults).
