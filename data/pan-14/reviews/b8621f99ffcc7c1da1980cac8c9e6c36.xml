The room we occupied faced the water, and it was your typical Marriott room. The room was clean, as was the bathroom. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Brunch at the restaurant was a bit pricey, but worth every penny. This hotel is in a good location. It was our first time to Seattle and we were able to walk to all the sites we wished to see. Yes, you do have to walk up a hill to reach the market, but there is an outdoor elevator that will take you up about 1/2 way up the hill. The rest of the hill was steep to us, but we live in a flat part of the country so I am sure that the steepness was a relative concept.Like other reviewers, we cashed in our Marriott points to stay in this hotel and were treated exceptionally well by any standards. I would stay here again.
