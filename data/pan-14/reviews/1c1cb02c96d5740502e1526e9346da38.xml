The service is first class in that it is attentive and all staff are friendly and helpful. I especially like the executive lounge and butlers pantryIssuesI booked a double without breakfast from the hotel web site at best rate guarenteed without breakfast (extra plus vatI then saw an offer with Hotels.com for a city break in the hotel for including breakfast and afternoon tea) plus vat - getting afternoon tea at not more cost was a better dealI emailed the hotel and asked about taking up ths offer and the email response was that I would have to cancel the reservation with the hotel and book with hotels,com.When I came to do this there wasnt a double available in the offer - it was available but for a dearer room - not suprising as there were no doubles left in the hotel as I'd booked one!I phoned the hotel and explained the situation and the lady said she would investigate and phone me back - which she didn't do even though she asked for my mobile numberWhen I got to the hotel and checked in I explained about this and asked whether it had been sorted and they said they had me down for the booking. I asked whether I could have the offer and this was brushed aside - the lady neither offered the city break deal nor offered to investigate - I got a feeling they didnt like to interfere with the booking system. I couldnt be bothered to persue it - however I expected a more proactive level of serviceOther minor niggles - not particuarly a problem but should they be happening in a 5 star hotel? - there was a welcome letter from the manager - very nice touch but he welcomed me back - 'nice to see you again' and this was my first visitI had been asked on the web site about my favourite fruit and there was none in the roomThe room was fine - but some noise from the road, no view and some issues again eg I couldnt turn the light off from my bed as the beds bedhead was jammed on the light switchThese are minor things but jarred as my expectations were high and not me I dont think I should have to ask/query things. No one ever said is everything OK , can I have some feedback, there was a feeling of isnt this wonderful hereBreakfast was nice but my scrambled eggs were not piping hot - they have to cook next door and it was which I think is expensive for what it wasOverall a lovely experience but not particulary good value for one and I probably woudnt stay with them again, especially if I am in a room by myself

The room was ideal for us - just enough space - only problem was with the toilet that leaked and overflowed once - it was dealt with promptly but should it happen? We got the feeling it was a regular occurence.We booked a limo from the airport through the hotel that we wouldnt recommend as we had to walk a while to parking and then the driver claimed he had waited so charged us $130 instead of $108 agreed - the plane was on time and we were quickly out so we didnt agree to pay and the hotel sorted it so we only paid the $108 - not a great way to start the holiday and next time I would get a cab. We booked a return limo for $90 and that was great We loved the 24/7 coffee/tea on tap - it was great to get back in an evening and get a 'cuppa' to take to bedThe breakfast was what we needed and the wine and cheese a treat - these facilities were a real plus for usWe booked loads of restaurants on opentable before we went following recommendations and they were all there when we arrived though we hadnt confirmedPicoline, Union Square Cafe and Gramercy tavern were greatWe loved Macys and the sale was onWe went on the tour bus - it was very cold so wasnt much fun but did see the areas of NYWe went to see the show at the Box and enjoyed it - drinks were very pricey but it was an experienceLocation of hotel was excellent - 42nd street has a major subway stop so all districts were accessible from thereNow I want to go back!Service is also great at the hotel - the staff were very obliging and helpful and honest and we felt they had their customers interests at heart
