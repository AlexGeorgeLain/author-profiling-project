We had a GREAT experience there during our 6-day stay. The room was quiet and comfortable, but the best part of the experience was the hotel staff and Carlos, the manager. They went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Carlos even saw it was my birthday during our visit and comped us to a bottle of Cava at the hotel bar. Just one example out of many of how great this staff was to us. And the location: best in Barcelona, right on Las Ramblas. Don't worry about light or street noises...blackout shutters come down at the push of a button. the staff restaurant suggestions, especially those from Carlos, were wonderful. Only one bad food experience: avoid La Gavina on the waterfront. It's a total ripoff with bad food and fish that isn't fresh. I wish every hotel was like this one!
