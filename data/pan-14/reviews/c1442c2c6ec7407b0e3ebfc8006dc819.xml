Bathroom modern and clean. We were located on the 8th floor, far above the busy traffic street. This might be a problem on lower floors. Noise does carry from room to room - not intrusively though. Front desk merely a holder of keys - no help with local information. Great location - 5 minutes to Girona station. I would stay here again. Did not eat the breakfast as previously suggested. Many little spots around the hotel to eat at for 1/4 the price.
