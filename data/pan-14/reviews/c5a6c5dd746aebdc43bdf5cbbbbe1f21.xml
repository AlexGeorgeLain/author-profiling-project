Great place for those on a budget and even better for those who aren't; so you can safe your money for better things (SHOPPING). Only a block away from the main strip which makes it very peaceful when you need those evening to catch up on sleep or a long day of activities at the beach. I will most definitely be staying here only when visiting Waikiki because the staffs are very friends and the house cleaning is top rate. Can't imagine any other place I would stay because what it boils down to is a clean and safe place to lay your head after a long day of fun.
