My husband and I chose the hotel because It is easily accessible near the Montgomery BART station and the venue of the wedding we were attending. Also, it is just a block away from Chinatown (you can literally see the Chinatown gate from the hotel doorway), North Beach, and is amidst all the great downtown SF shopping. The staff were helpful and housekeeping service was good. Room decor was classy and clean.CONS:There is no free internet service which seems crazy to me in this day and age, especially in a city like San Francisco. Also, the only elevator is this loud old machine and our room happened to be right next to it. Try to request a room that is not adjacent to the elevator, otherwise you will be tossing and turning on Saturday nite when people return to the hotel at all hours of the night. Another downside is the only ice machine is in the hotel lobby.
