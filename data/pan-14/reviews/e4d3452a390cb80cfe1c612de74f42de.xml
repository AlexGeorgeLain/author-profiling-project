I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. From the CDG airport, take the Roissy bus straight to the Opera and it is a few minute walk to the hotel. The hotel has an elevator, which is not so common for Paris; although it is small, it sure helped a lot with the huge three pieces of luggage that we had. The rooms are clean and neat, contemporary style, with balconies. The staff was extremely friendly, our son felt like at home in the office since he wanted to play with Mme dog each morning while we were having a leisurely breakfast. As for the breakfast itself: it was excellent, with a wide variety of options to choose from. For North Americans not willing to try the superb green tomato or fig jams (which I managed to find in a Provencal store and take home with me), there is cereal, orange juice etc. One can also sit outside in the small courtyard (weather permitting). An extremely nice touch from the Director was a bottle of champagne waiting in our room on my birthday (information leaked from our son). All in all, I do not think we will consider a different hotel next time we are in Paris.Family Baronian, Toronto
