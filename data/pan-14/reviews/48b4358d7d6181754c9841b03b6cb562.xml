It has the best bed and pillows of all the hotels we stayed with (intercon, elysian, hard rock). Very very comfy with the luxurious 1000 thread count cover. And also the best room, great attention to detail, although the TV is getting outdated. The spa is also very nice.The beach is very average, nothing compared to the beach of jimbaran. The surrounding area is very quiet, with nothing much going on. Try Bumbu Desa down the road, it serve authentic balinese food. Another must try is the new Tratorria at Jimbaran. They serve amazing italian food, with great atmosphere at a budget price!
