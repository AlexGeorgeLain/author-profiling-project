This is something I can never quite get a handle on. Additionally, I would qualify the bathroom as badly designed.The furnishings in the room were comfortable but a little shabby. On the plus side, the room was kept very clean and the housekeepers were amiable. I used the business center, which was efficient and practical.For price and location, it is a pretty good deal though I would probably try out a different hotel next time.

Was glad that I booked one of the large balcony rooms (74) and was even more impressed by the wonderful metal and wood SOHO sign on the terrace ledge.The room itself was very well organised, with an excellent working/living space and a comfortable bed. Different lighting combinations could be set to make the room look warmer or cooler.Breakfast was included in the price and it was very attractively presented in a funky environment.Street noise was slightly annoying but this is to be expected on the Gran Via.I would definitely consider coming back to stay at this hotel.
