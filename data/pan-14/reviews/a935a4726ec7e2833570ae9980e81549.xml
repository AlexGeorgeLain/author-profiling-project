Every year on that day the hotel shuts off the air conditioning and all restaurants are closed. The hotel did have a beach party with food and alcohol. We complained about this to the manager and received a gift cert for the spa which was very nice. I would definately go back to this hotel, but not on Sept 30! If you go, you must go to the pool bar(wet bar) and visit Victor. If you see Victor, you must sample the Mammawanna. It gets squirted right into your mouth! You can get it in a cup if you choose. Every day at the pool by the bar, there are activities at 4pm. Very fun! The beach was beautiful! Best I've seen, so far. Rooms were nice. Food was ok, not the greatest except for the Japanese restaurant. You must make reservations at the Japanese restaurant! Very good food. I had the salmon and shrimp and it was awesome! All the employees were sooooo nice, especially Anna and Eddie. The dico plays Dominican music but if you write down an American song the DJ will go online and pull up the song and play it.
