The staff and the room were fantastic. In my initial email I stated that it was to be our last two nights and they upgraded us to the love room which has a balcony overlooking madison avenue and with partial views of the real new york library. Nothing was ever too much and Bill, thank you for getting the pizza's when we arrived too late for the two very nice restaurants next door. We tried the pera the next night, which was turkish/mediteraean food. It was lovely, although a touch expensive overall. My wife baulked at the cost of the library originally, but by the end of it, she agreed that t was well worth it. Great location, romantic and accomodating. Thank you all at the library.

You're right by time square, some great restaurants (joe allens was great - get the meatloaf) all the broadway shows, the cheap ticket desk is on the same street if you want to buy same day tickets at half price. We bookended our honeymoon to mexico from london with two nights at the start and end in new york. We finished up at the library, which was over twice the price, although great aswell. i would recommend doing something similair. however if i was to have just one hotel i would go with the 414, there are so many other things in new york to sepnd your money on than just a hotel!
