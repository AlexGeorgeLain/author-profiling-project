Flew Ryanair from East Mids airport to Girona airport, easy to pick up taxi outside airport. Took us an hour to Hotel, 120euros, ok because there were three of us. We had room 711 at Hotel, triple room, very clean, plenty of room. Good location, 5mins walk to Las Ramblas. Turn right out of Hotel and across road to pick up orange open topped bus for tour of city, good value, 19 euros for the day. Hailed a taxi, turn left out of Hotel, went to Port Olimpic on the Sat night, 10euros, plenty of restaurants, a great area. Called at Arts Hotel for a drink, very posh, see how the other half live!. No hesitation in recommending Hotel Jazz and Barcelona, we had a great time.Kay, Angie and Angie.
