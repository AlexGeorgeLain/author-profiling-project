It is two minutes from London Bridge Station, and represents really good value for money. The hotel is modern and decorated to a high standard. The bedroom was a good size with a large and comfotable bed and had plenty of wardrobe and bathroom space. The staff were all very friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast room was very busy on both days that we stayed, but the staff were very quick to clear tables, find space for people to sit, keep the breakfast buffet topped up and bring tea, coffee etc. There was a good selection of food for breakfast and the cooking was good. It was a most enjoyable stay and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.
