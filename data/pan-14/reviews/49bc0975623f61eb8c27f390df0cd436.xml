Especially w/ Priceline rate The people who complain about this place need to be staying at The Plaza or something.It's clean. The rooms are large. It's central to the theatre district.We had a relatively low floor but still enjoyed a view of the new Westin (with the funky light) and the river.I paid $110 on Priceline. I guess if I paid $250 or something, I'd be underwhelmed.I would definitely come again, even at a somewhat higher price.
