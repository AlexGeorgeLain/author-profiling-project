The check-in went smooth, the room was spacious and clean, and the restaurant and bar offered tasty and reasonably priced food and beverages. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and answered all of our questions with skill.The hotel location was great and convenient to numerous Beverly Hills restaurants. Within a ten to fifteen minute walk up Beverly Drive were food establishments in all price ranges, boutique shopping, and upscale Rodeo Drive. I would recommend the hotel to anyone without hesitation.
