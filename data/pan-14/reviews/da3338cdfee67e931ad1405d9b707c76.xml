We were in another building owned by the hotel which was about a block away -- little annoying to have to go to the main building for breakfast (which was quite basic but ok), but this wasn't a big deal.The room itself was ok. Bed was comfortable and it was quiet, but I did not like how few ammenities there were (lack of towels, for example). Spotted a couple spiders and such as well in the room. Our room had a door that opened up to a 'garden' type of place, which was nifty, and I assume this is where the bugs came from. There was a TV with satellite, but it would stop working after a few minutes.Location was 15 min away from the heart of the city though only 5 min from the main station; no complaints here.All in all, it was an ok stay, but I think I'd choose another place in Florence next time if I can find something at a similar price.
