Recently I had the pleasure of Staying at the Bestwestern Inn at Longwood for an extended stay due to an illness, I needed to be near the hospitals. The hotel went above and beyond to make sure that my stay was comfortable considering the circumstances of my illness. I have never met a more accommodating staff in all of my years of travel. I will forever be grateful for the wonderful service I recieved ~ it made a tough time pleasureable!! Thank you to Brian Stiglets the GM and his staff for everything!!!
