The room was built into the roof, so tall people would have to duck under some of the beams, but at 5'3 i had no problems! (My boyfriend is 6 ft and there was only the beam by the front door that he had to duck under, but the room was big enough that you didn't need to go near it again!) Painted blue, with a print on one of the walls, the room was kinda quirky. It was quite spacious, with a cute bathroom which was clean and modern. Fresh towels were provided each day, but the rooms were not tidied during our stay.The front desk was always friendly, and its 24 hours, which gives you peace of mind. There are wi-fi internet facilities in the hotel, however I didn't have my laptop with me, so they let me use their computer to check into my flight! Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel, although it looked good, but wanted to get out and about so didn't try it out. Its an additional for breakfast.We paid for the 3 night stay. It wasn't cheap, but it was good quality, in a good location with friendly service. I would stay again, and would definitely recommend to my friends.
