It is very convenient, quiet, immaculately clean, and has probably the best staff I've encountered anywhere. They booked a concert for us, taxis and restaurants, and were always ready to give advice and suggestions or just to have a chat. If a light bulb went out, it was changed at once. The aquarium was amazing: I never even knew that you could grow corals like this.The constantly available chocolate, tea etc and cookies or cake were so much better than tea-making in the room.Our room was a little dark as there was scaffolding outside, but what the hell, we were only there to sleep. The room had everything we wanted, (including BBC1 2 on the TV). Even though the refurbishment was going on, it didn't inconvenience us and the workmen were very polite and tried to minimise the effect of their works. Amazing to see the corridors newly papered in a day!This family owned and run hotel is an example to all.
