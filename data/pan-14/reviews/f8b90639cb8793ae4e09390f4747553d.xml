Rooms Were small but all rooms in Japan are small. Had a Twin room on 12 floor. Big LCD tv in room Only 1 English Channel on TV CNN and because of the Time difference to the US of +16 there are hardly anything on it. There was a Guest Lounge on the 2nd Floor with 2 Computers for internet + Water and Tea and Coffee Machines. Easy to get to from Shinjuku Station South Exit. Turn Right out the station walk to the end of the road Turn Right Again and there it is. We found it without a map just from looking at the map on the Hotel website.
