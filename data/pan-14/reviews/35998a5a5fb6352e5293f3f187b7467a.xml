Although we arrived at breakfast time, the hotel swiftly allocated us a room, so that we could freshen up and sally forth into the city promptly. The hotel is ultra modern and we had a room with a magnificent panoramic view of the skyscrapers of the Tung Chung district. The room was exceptionally well furnished and equipped. The hotel is adjacent to a very modern and extensive shopping precinct and an underground station for the 25 minute ride into the centre. The buffet dinner at very reasonable cost is an unforgettable experience and to judge from the large number of local people who partook of it, they must also be of the same opinion. This is a great place to stay particularly if you have an early start and like me are nervous about reaching the airport in good time.

Very comfortable and modern with a nice restaurant as well as being very close to other eating places. Staff could not have been more helpful and a particular benefit is that the main hotel is a stop on the route of the Airport Limousine service so transit to and from the airport is entirely hassle free as well as cheap.
