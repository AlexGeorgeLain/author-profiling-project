Great beaches, beatiful palm-trees around the pool, lots of variety in food and beverage (all inclusive). We've been in other Club Med (in Brazil) and found Punta Cana's one a little bit smaller and old but the service was perfect. One comment: a standard family definitely needs a wardrove... there's no place to put your clothes. The rest of the facilities, services in the beach and overall was great for families. Snorkeling was fun for small kids, too. You don't need to get a trip far away, fishes are all around the beach close to kids.Airport services and other places outside Club Med was not that good. Everything is really expensive until you start a quick and hard negotiation. You can get the same service or goods at half the price sometimes.A place to go, definitely!
