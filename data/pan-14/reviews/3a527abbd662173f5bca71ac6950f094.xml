In the first months you could get an excellent room for less than inc breakfast. Just a few years later it has become really popular and the full rate last week was over ex breakfast!The decor is bright and modern, and the rooms are excellent to work in. Free internet (ask for a cable when you check in if you do not use wifi), and a Mac in the room!There's no tube station nearby.
