It is a grand old hotel in need of some loving care. On our first visit, two years ago, we really enjoyed the art deco styling and the beach and diving adjacent to the property all for a price that was very reasonable (we paid about $160 this time). This time however, was very different. There was a lot of noisy construction underway inside the hotel and there had been some water damage in our room so it smelled very musty. Everything seemed run down and just not of the quality we remembered. On our last day we walked next door to the Caribe Hilton and it was everything you want in a hotel, all for only about $30 more per night. Trust me, that would be money well spent.
