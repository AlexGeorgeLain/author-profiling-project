The hotel was small and not all rooms are perfect but after a couple of moves we ended up in a perfect room. What made the stay however was the little extras, a nice nespresso coffee machine in each room, free coffee in the bar area and free wine and beer between certain times in the lounge.Although not worth much financially it was great to not have to worry that every thing you wanted during your stay was going to be an extra on the bill. There was even a decanter in the room included in the rate.Overall a great spot, close but not surrounded, and with a feeling of a very classy boutique hotel.
