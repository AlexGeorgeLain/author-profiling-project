It is a wonderful clean place to stay and but two short blocks to Fisherman's Wharf. Earily evening free wine tasting (or wine drinking- they give you a full glass af several wines). In the morning free great coffee and biscotti in the lobby- with carry-out cups.Our room was always cleaned but they only give out 2 towels? I guess you only get one towel per day.It was interesting that we received a better room price by going thru Travelocity then by calling the hotel direct???If we ever return we would try to stay here for the third time..
