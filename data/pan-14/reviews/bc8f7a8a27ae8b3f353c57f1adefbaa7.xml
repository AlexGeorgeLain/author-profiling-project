The beach and pool areas were excellent. Nice large towels and comfy lounge chairs. I found the restaurants in the Hotel to be pricey. We went across the street to the plaza and found the food to be cheaper and better. Be warned: the fast food retaurants are very slow! My only complaint is the housekeeping was good some days and bad other days. The street the Hotel was on, was sometimes difficult to cross. But other than that it was all good.
