Fabrizio gave us wonderful suggestions as to where to eat at places that were reasonably priced and not touristy. Our room was beautiful, clean and even had a laptop computer with internet which was quite a surprise. Every morning we enjoyed a delicious breakfast served in the cozy dining room. The evening happy hour in the candlelit room with the Chianti, Perseco and delicious bruschetta was a special treat which was included in the price. We would highly recommend to anyone visiting Florence to stay here and enjoy the hospitality and warmth of Davanzati.
