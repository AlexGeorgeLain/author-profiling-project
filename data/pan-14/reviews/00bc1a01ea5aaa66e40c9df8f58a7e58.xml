Modestly sized for European hotels, it was very comfortable for one or two people. The room was very clean.The decor is modern. Interestingly, the shower area had a glass wall that was shared with the sleeping area. Modesty is preserved through strategically placed glass frosting, but if you're traveling with a non-intimate friend you might be a bit uncomfortable. Also, the bathroom had a bottle opener on the wall, which I thought very considerate (it probably avoids damage to the surfaces - who among us have not found novel ways of opening bottles?).The room included an in-room safe that fit a 15 laptop (much appreciated), and a mini-bar (which I didn't use). A flat panel TV with several English channels was included. Free internet was provided, which is unique in European hotels.The location is very convenient between the Amsterdam Centraal Station and the big museums (Van Gogh and the Rijksmuseum). It's about a 20 minute walk or so from the station, but there is a tram station about 50 yards from the hotel on Rembrandt Square. Tram line 4 and 9 go between the rail station and Rembrandt Square. The hotel is just off the square. It doesn't look like much from the street, but appearances are deceiving. There is a restaurant attached, which I didn't use.All in all, a very nice hotel that American travelers will find familiar and very comfortable. On a personal note, they allowed me to check in at 10am, which I very much appreciated. This was not arranged ahead of time.
