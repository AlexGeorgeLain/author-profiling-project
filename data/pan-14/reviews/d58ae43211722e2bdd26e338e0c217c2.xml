We were put in the Los Olas section, which is run down, concrete walls chipping, wood railings rotted, and carpeting in the lobby of Los Olas was filthy. Our room had been remodeled and was very pretty, but someone had not cleaned properly. They were very accommodating and moved us to the Marina, a new building and new rooms.....very satisified until we checked into the room (the only one available, according to them) and our premium ocean view room was right over the major construction of a water park, Coqui, which started promptly at 8AM and went until 6PM with backhoes, etc. and way too much noise to even sit on our deck overlooking the ocean! The food was outrageously priced.....such as $9.00 for a KIDS hotdog or $14 for a cheeseburger......and the list goes on. Won't go back. People were very friendly, however! Oh, the night kayaking ($89 per person) was a huge disappointment. The lumenated kayaks were nothing more than a Halloween glow stick on the front and back of the boats! Lots of rowing in the dark to see a little bit of luminance in the water......
