You could be one of the unfortunate people, as we were, to get a teeny tiny room, no hairblower, no bathtub, dirty window sills, and a bed in very bad shape. I wouldn't even relogate this room to the shabby sheik category. After we complained we did get another much better room. The manager, who made no apologies, did imply that it was up to us to have asked for a different room. Unbelievably he advised us that this room was UNDER RENOVATION for handicapped. It was a new one on us that for $400 plus each nite, for 5 nites, we were to worry that our room would look like it did and it was our responsibility to investigate the room ahead of time. Having travelled all over the world I would submit this was one of a very few awful experiences for us.Unless you absolutely adore breakfast and need cheese and wine at 4 o'clock I would stay somewhere else. The hotel is on the East side of the city and major museums and theater, Lincoln Center, etc. are on the west side. There are many accolades on this site regarding Elysee. Indeed if we had had the second room the first time, I wouldn't be writing this review. A word of warning then. Be certain you see your room ahead of time.
