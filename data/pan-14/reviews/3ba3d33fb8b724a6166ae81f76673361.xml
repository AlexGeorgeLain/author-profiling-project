We arrived at 8.30am just expecting them to store our luggage which they did no problem but also told us to go ahead and have breakfast which is a very good extended buffet served in a lovely lounge The bedroom was clean but small and very noisy being at the front of the hotel. The safe did not work they did try to repair it but they do have safety boxes at reception no charge for them The friendly staff and breakfast make this hotel an ideal stay in New York not to mention the great location We travelled from JFK to Penn Street by Airtrain and Metro from Howard Beach $7 each walked from Penn Street to hotel Metro
