We stayed with them for 3 nights from 4 June and, despite it being a large, corporate hotel, all the staff were very friendly and helpful (extra brownie points to the lady in the Gift Shop who doubles as the Concierge for going the extra mile). Our room was large, well furnished and well maintained and our pre-travel request of a room high up and overlooking the bay had been granted. We made the mistake of picking up our car at the airport on arrival and thought the hotel's car parking charge was unreasonable. We didn't like the polystyrene cups on the drinks tray either, but found that they were used by a lot of hotels on our travels. If you're a tea drinker, then take your own. Apart from those 2 niggles, we enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn Golden Gateway as it was very central and we were able to walk to most places.
