The room was nice but a little small compared with other Sebels we have stayed in, and lacking in storage space. Water view was good, though maybe not as good as we had expected. Service was erratic - missing items were slow in coming, though some of the staff were very helpful. The worst thing was the meal - slow service and poorly cooked food, not recommended. However, the location is very good, a short walk to the Rocks and Circular quay, but nothing much close by. A short walk will get you a bus right into downtown - Queen Victoria Building - we used this several times and found it most useful. Overall it was a good experience, but I might look elsewhere next time.
