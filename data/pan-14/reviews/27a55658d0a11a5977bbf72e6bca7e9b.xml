Hotel employees were courteous and attentive. Some language barrier, but with only limited spanish on our part, we did fine. Tips are appreciated and remembered. These employees are working 12 hour days sometimes 6-7 days a week. They might have an off day, but a smile and a tip makes their work days better. Check in was a breeze. I recommend arriving on an off day (not a Saturday) as there were only us (girls trip - 2 moms, 2 daughters) and one other couple checking in on the day we arrived. We arrived at the hotel at 11:15 AM and even though they say check in is at 3:00 PM, we had our room and was settled by 12:15. Rooms were clean. Beach is a short but beautiful walk. Wasn't sure what to expect with all the reviews prior, but was very pleasantly surprised. Caution on the open air markets. Vendors are very pushy. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. Only drawback is the shopping center they have on site. Lots of empty stores, must still be under construction. For us, this was not a problem as we weren't there for shopping. The pizzeria was the best. Give Addison Frankie a smile, they are the best.
