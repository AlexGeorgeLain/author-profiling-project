The room was a typical Westin - generally clean, average amenities, nice bathrobes and towels. This Westin had particularly thin walls - and i surely heard loud and clear noises that I did not want to hear. Ipod alarm clock would have been nice, but didn't work and I couldn't set the alarm. The front desk staff were very nice, the folks at 0 were rude.In general, just another stay in a new york hotel
