However, the charm and location more than make up for the small room size. After all, who goes on vacation to sit in a hotel room and watch TV anyways!?!? My room was very clean and I appreciated all the little extras such as the flowers, bag of (useful!) goodies, and VERY comfortable bed.The Mosser Hotel is located in the most ideal location imaginable. About a 3 minute walk to the cable cars, close to many shops and convenience stores, Chinatown, Coit Tower, the Embarcadero, etc.Very unique hotel and reasonable rates as well.
