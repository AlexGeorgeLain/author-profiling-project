I traveled with my Girlfriend and it was also her first time out of the country. Everyone was so nice and treated us like royalty, even in the airport. Some people have horror stories about the airport but not me. We only stayed from Monday - Friday and wish we would have stayed longerThe bus ride to the Excellence was a LONG ride but it was interesting to see everything around the area and how much it looks like some of the locals struggle. They are creating a Freeway to all the resorts so it will be much easier to get to each resort shortly. Once we got to the Hotel we were treated like we were at home in our own mansion. We met a couple on the plane which we hung out with a lot and they had nothing but good things to say also.I am a very very picky eater so I wasn't too into any of the food except the Grill, the steak at the grill was awesome. The room service was also great, especially the french toast for breakfast.The shows at night were AWESOME, we had a michael jackson show which was just insane!!! The whole entertainment team was amazing, CARLOS especially was awesome and always would say hi to us and talk to us. We were in the dance club one night and he was showing us some Dominican Dances which was awesome. He made us feel so welcome and when we were leaving we saw him and he was mad we were leaving. We were both very upset to leave but we had to get back to the real world to work. If you have questions about the trip or anything specific you can contact me.
