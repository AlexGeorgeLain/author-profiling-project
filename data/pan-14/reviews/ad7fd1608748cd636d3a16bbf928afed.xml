The difference was a doubling in their rates. This is NOT a $200 a night property.I used to be an airline pilot and used to stay at this hotel regularly - over 60 nights a year. It was ok - restaurant is very expensive but there is a little cafe next door which is reasonable where all the Qantas office workers go for their meals. Botany Road is a ten minute walk and there are many hole-in-the-wall restaurants there that are worth walking to. Out at the airport there is nothing to do, though - no nightlife or attractions of any kind, although this property offers convenience. It was great at arrive and get to this hotel after a long flight and crash into bed, so convenience is what they offer - but the rates are too high for the level of quality and they lose me there since it makes no sense to be paying this rate . The train station is a five minute walk and it's easy to go there and jump a train to the city center.Our rate was A$100 a night, and at that rate it was ok. Their present rates are just nuts! It's also getting worn - carpets are poor, bedspreads need cleaning. The place is either getting beaten to death or simply not being refurbished/maintained.
