The room was ok...nothing to remember. The worst part of our stay was all the screaming and shouting we heard during the 2 days of our stay....specially because it woke us up several times. The breakfast service was better than what we expected...so we would recomende it. If you need a good hotel, in a good area and from this chain, I would recommend U232.
