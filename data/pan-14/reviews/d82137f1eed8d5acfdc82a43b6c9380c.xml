Excellent transport links made this a good choice for us - next to tram, bus and train stops, 15 mins from airport, and 20 mins to cross the whole of Amsterdam by the fast and frequent tram No 4. We bought a 48 hour all-in ticket for E10 which took us everywhere except to and from the airport by train. We expected a modern business hotel, which it is, but were pleasantly surprised by the efficient professional friendly service, by the excellent breakfasts included in our E125 double, and a very good evening meal at E35 each including simple drinks. Buffet breakfast had the option of full English, Continental with fine beef, ham and cheeses, lots of fruit and yoghourt and decent strong coffee. Clean, comfortable room, with good lighting. Only real minus was smoking in the reception area. Would be happy to return even though we generally prefer older atmospheric hotels right in the centre of cities. Clifford and Patricia Gould. Somerset, England.
