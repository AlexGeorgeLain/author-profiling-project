The Intercontinental is a lovely hotel.The restaurant bar are exceptional.Just problem while i was there in Oct.There is a building site to the right of the hotel,where many of the rooms face!So noise can be a problem.Also the front of the hotel faces the Boston fire Dept.That was very noisyon 1 of the nights i stayed there.
