He helped us with anything we requested.The parking garage is probably the cheapest in town, $10.00 a day if you get a form from the front desk that shows you are a guest, otherwise its $18.00 a day.There is some construction going on but we never noticed any noise, we were on the 36th floor, a beautiful view.The beds were comfortable and NO ROACHES on either of our visits!Yes, the bathrooms are a little small but what do you want, a dance hall? They get the job done, tub,toilet and a sink. Some people expect the Ritz for the price of a budget hotel. We paid $67.00 a nite and I believe we more than got our moneys worth!When you go out to eat you have got to try the Galaxy Steak House. When you leave the Colony, turn left onto Seaside, go to the light (Kuhio), turn left about two or three blocks then cross the street. Its on the second floor next to Mad Dogs. They serve a breakfast for $2.75 and dinner for $11.95. Dont order the buy one juice get one free, the juice will almost double your bill. There is a character on the sidewalk out front name of Dave. He is a hoot, really funny guy. Tell him Jon from Harrahs sent you, he will get a kick out of that.Another good but pricey restaurant is Mateos on the corner of Kuhio Seaside, excelent Itialian. For 3 of us it came to $100.00We are coming back in September 2008 and will definitely be staying with our friens at the Colony
