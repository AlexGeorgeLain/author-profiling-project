I should have listened to my instincts! It looks closed from the outside, the scaffolding has gone, but the building is still filthy and massively knocked about.There are dustsheets everywhere covering the interior, paper over a new marble floor in the foyer, generally a very poor first impression. The staff seem pleasant, although take proof of your booking, we were told that breakfast wasn't included for expedia guests, luckily our confirmation email said that it did. You do need to go along the road to a different hotel for excellent buffet style breakfast.We were given one of the refurbished rooms, just as pictured on the website, but perhaps using trick photography!! Quite possibly the smallest double room I've ever been in, you are able to walk round the bed, but there was only about a foot to spare at the bottom. No bedside cabinets or lamps, but the most inappropriately large desk you've ever seen, no chair though!The ensuite was very nice, everything you need, but very snug with a glass door into the bedroom.The air conditioning worked and was needed, it was very warm overnight.
