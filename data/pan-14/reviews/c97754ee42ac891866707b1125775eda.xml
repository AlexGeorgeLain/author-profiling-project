We had a corner room on the first floor with three French balcony windows, very bright, it was small, but clean and completely sufficient for our needs. The staff, and particularly the hotel manager, were friendly, upbeat, helpful and happily for my sad French levels, spoke English very well. The area of Paris the Grand Francais is located in may not be right at the centre of all the tourist action, but that's one of the things that's nice about it. We did all our sightseeing downtown during the day, then came home to a very lovely residential area in the evenings. Still well within the city, but quieter, and very easily accessible to everywhere by Paris's amazing Metro system. If I'm ever lucky enough to return to Paris, this is where I'll definitely stay again. Thank you, Grand Francais!
