However we were pleasantly surprised. All the staff were polite and extremely helpful. The breakfast buffet was very good and the tea and coffee excellent.We stayed in the Europa building which had a very nice lounge and a bar and cafeteria which sold reasonably priced snacks and drinks. It was used by the locals on Sunday afternoon and also in the morning on their way to work.Our room was kept spotlessly clean and had a wonderful shower.Their was an excellent Italian restaurant over the road called Gino's and it was only a short walk to the Sainz de Barans metro.The lovely Parque de Retiro was a short stroll away. If we ever return to Madrid we will definitely stay at the Ayre Gran Colon again.
