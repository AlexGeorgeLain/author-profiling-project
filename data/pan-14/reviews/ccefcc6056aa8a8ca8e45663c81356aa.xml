We chose it because it was reasonably priced and within easy waking distance to cross the bridge into old Firenze. We had great breakfasts the 2 days we were in Florence, and the staff made us reservations at a great restaurant just across the Arno River. They also arranged a Tuscany tour for us. The only drawbacks were the cost for using their garage for our rental car, and phone charges to call '800' numbers to fix ATM card problems.
