We had requested a room in the older part of the hotel and were given a wonderful ocean view room on the 3rd floor.The hotel was everything that we had dreamt about. The staff were excellent and we could not fault anyone. Our room was always spotless and the breakfast each day was memorable. We also enjoyed our drinks each evening in the Mai Bar. We loved the hotel and its attentive staff so much that we are planning to return in the not too distant future for a longer stay. The only trouble being the long flight across the Pacific Ocean. It truly is a gem and we hope it stays that way forever.
