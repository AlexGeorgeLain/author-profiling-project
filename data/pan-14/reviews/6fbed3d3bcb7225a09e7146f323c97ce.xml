Our room was on the 25th floor with views over the city Overall the upgrade was well worth the money.The hotel is very well positioned being close to the BART, cable cars and local transprort. Its very close to major shopping areas - our teenage daughters particularly liked Forever 21 clothing store situated 200metres away. There were a number of vagrants in the area, and indeed in San Francisco, but generally they were harmless and usually polite.We found the hotel of a high standard with pleasant staff and would not hesitate to go back there.
