It was my first trip to the city so was not too sure what to expect. From the minute we pulled up to the hotel we knew we had picked The lobby is very attractive with a trendy bar/restaurant. Although this is quite expensive the food is very good. There is also a deli type cafe right next door to the hotel which we had breakfast in and a few snacks. The location of the hotel couldnt be better. On East 42nd st places like Times Square, 5th Avenue are only a few munutes walk. It is also nice to have Grand Central Station about a block away so you can get the underground to pretty much any where in the city. Both of our rooms (My family and our friends) were excellant. The rooms looked very well kept and attractive. It was an added bonus as we had a fantastic view of the enitre Christler Building (vertually opposite the hotel). All in all a great hotel and facilities. If I go back to NY I would deffinately stay at the New York Helmsley.
