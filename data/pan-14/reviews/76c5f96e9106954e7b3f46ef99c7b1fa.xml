After reading some of the reviews, we were a little doubtful, but went for it anyway. Thankfully we were more than satisfied. The room was great (In the new part of the hotel). The best shower I've ever used in a hotel. Some of the reviews say that the reception staff are unfriendly. We found them polite and helpfull. What you have to remember is that this is a city, not a beach or holiday resort hotel. They do not thrust tours, places to visit etc in your face, but if you ask for assistance with maps, places to visit etc they are more than happy to help. From our experience of city breaks most city hotels seem to operate in the same way.Breakfast. Excellent food, all fresh and varied.Eating out. Try and dine at the smaller restaurants tucked away in the side street off Las Ramblas. On our first night we ate at a restaurant on Ramblas and paid 65 euros for 2 beers, a slice of spanish omelette, 2 Greek salads and a chicken pealla. The next 3 nights we ate off the main streets, and had very good food. Hope you find this useful. Enjoy Barcelona, we did.
