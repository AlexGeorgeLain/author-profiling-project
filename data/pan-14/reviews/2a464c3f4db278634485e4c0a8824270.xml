I did, however, get a fantastic deal on a website called hoteldirect I think and got a beautiful yet small single room with breakfast included. I turned up on Saturday afternoon and have to say that my entire stay was memorable! The room was beautiful, the bed so comfortable and the bed linen elegant and fine. The bathroom was gleaming marble with lots of lovely goodies and a huge shower. I was on the 3rd floor and it was incredible quiet. On Sunday morning, I ordered room service for breakfast which was such a treat and delicious. I don't often have the need to stay in London, as I live near Richmond but the hotel made my weekend a weekend to remember! Thank you The Chesterfield!
