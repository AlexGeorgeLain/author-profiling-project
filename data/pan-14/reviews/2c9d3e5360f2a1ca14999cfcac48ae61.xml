The roof top swimming pool was stunning. Breakfast was standard buffet fare. The location for shopping was very good as it is very close to a number of larger shopping malls The overall experience was marred by problems with the hotel reservation booking system. After half-a-dozen calls from the UK to Hong Kong to inform them of our change of plans, they still tried to charge us for the night we had cancelled well in advance.For a 5* hotel, I did expect better customer service rather than drawn out discussions as to why they felt they had to charge us.
