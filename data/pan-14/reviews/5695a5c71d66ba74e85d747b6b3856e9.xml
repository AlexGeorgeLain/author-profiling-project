Not only did we meet the cast of the T.V. show LOST once, we met them twice. The first time we saw them was the night of the last episode with one of the male castmembers (the brother of the pretty blonde girl). The cast wasa celebrating with a dinner at the five star Golden Dragon restaurant. Other than the celebrities, the animals and scenery was MAGNIFICENT. Oh, and I almost forgot! Watch your children in the ocean, because while we were there, a japanese man nearly drowned in the ocean, and if it wasnt for my parents and a few nurses on vacation, he surely would have drowned. And the lifeguard.....he was too far away to even know there was a drowning person. He finally showed up right as the paramedics arrived. The hotel treated us right when they found out we helped save that man's life. I reccomend this resort to anyone visiting Honolulu!
