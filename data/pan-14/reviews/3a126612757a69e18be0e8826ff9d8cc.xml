Well came 2006 and I decided on another visit and booked through my agent.After booking I looked through the review page nad was disappointed to see some of the comments and wondered if the Hotel had gone 'downhill'. I had no need to worry, the staff were helpful, the room although on the small size was adequate for our needs and the breakfast was far better than some better rated hotels I have been to. For the price of a night Band B it was great value.It was clean, and it's siting was second to none. If I had a complaint it would be that during the few days I chose to go, Chelsea were playing Barcelona and the noise at night permeated everywhere. This is not the Hotels fault but it meant a rather sleepless night on the Tuesday.Overall, a good, clean, above average hotel with a great command of the city's features. Close to the Metro, Port, Ramblas, Placa Catalunya (where all day tours seem to start from).If I go back, I will certainly book there again (for the 4th time).
