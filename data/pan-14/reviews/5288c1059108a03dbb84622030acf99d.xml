We were not in anyway disappointed. We chose to avoid the La Rambla area for noise reasons, but wanted to be within walking distance. Excellent location in Gracia district. Great shopping, close to Fontana subway station and a good walk to La Rambla. We had an interior room overlooking the courtyard. which was very quiet. We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on breakfast. This hotel while dated, was clean and comfortable and good value for the Euro charged and a great safe location. Would recommend.
