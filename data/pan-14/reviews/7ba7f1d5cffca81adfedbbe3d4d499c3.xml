I was only planning to go there to see Seattle with a friend, and have a place to sleep. I didn't care at all about having anything fancy, just a clean, secure, conveniently located hotel room. They delivered.The manager was incredibly friendly, and the staff made some good suggestions of things to see and do. The room was clean, and building was reasonably quiet for a downtown hotel and seemed secure.I'll definitely go back as long as I find a good price.

The staff gave great suggestions of places to stop while I was in town and were very helpful. The location was very convenient, and I had a great view of the Seattle Library.I really have no complaints, it was a great stay and the price was excellent.
