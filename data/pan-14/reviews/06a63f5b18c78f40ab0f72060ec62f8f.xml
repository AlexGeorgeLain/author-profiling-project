It is family operated and they treat their guests like family. The room was clean and recently renovated, but most importantly, it was quiet although it is situated only minutes from the Duomo and David. Breakfast is fine, nothing fancy. Wonderful location for sightseeing and the bus/train terminal. They gave discount for payment in cash. I would definitely stay here again.
