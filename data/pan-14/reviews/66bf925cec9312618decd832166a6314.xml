We had a look at many other hotels in the area to find what else there was, but rooms were quite pleasant here. Nicely furnished and great ambience. Conatined everything necessary!The hotel: The hotel itself is very open inside. It is hollow, exposing each floor from the very top to the bottom level. It has very spacious floors. When you leave your room and look over the balcony, you can see the lobby bar. The external view we had from our room was quite dissapointing as it was obstructed by a concrete beam. The location: The hotel is very convenienty located to many shopping malls which are all in walking distance, there are many other surrounding hotels. Service: Service is very good, staff are extremely friendly and are always willing to help.Breakfast: Huge variety for breakfast, both continental and hot which includes the usual western cuisine as well as eastern.
