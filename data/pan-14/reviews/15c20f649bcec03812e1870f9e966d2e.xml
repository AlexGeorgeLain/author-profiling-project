We were amazed by the view from our 20th floor suite - it seemed like a four day entertainment that had been put on for us with the bridge, opera house, the harbour and the Rocks area in full and splendid view. The suite was just like a home with everything that we needed and the space...................amazing!Melanie, Graham and Melissa could not have been more helpful from the moment we arrived to when we left.Also, it is so convenient with George St, Circular Quay and the main shops just a few minutes away.Breakfast was excellent and although we had planned to try other places, after the first day, we only wanted to breakfast there. We were truly sorry to leave after our 4 days and look forward to going back as soon as possible.
