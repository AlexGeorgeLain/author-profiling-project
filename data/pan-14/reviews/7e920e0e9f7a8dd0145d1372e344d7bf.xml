Best thing about the hotel is the location, with Knutsford Terrace just round the corner. Some excellent restaurants and plenty of bars. Plus only 10-15 minute walk to the Star Ferry.Rooms are clean and reasonably well equipped - my tour operator had requested an upgrade as I was celebrating my 40th birthday when I was there, but didn't get it.If breakfast isn't included in your booking, don't use the hotel's. There are loads of diner-style restaurants nearby where you can get breakfast at a fraction of the cost.Others have mentioned that the porters come down the hill to take up your luggage - don't know where they were when we arrived, but my poor husband had to haul two cases up the hill, which was exhausting after an 11 hour flight. Overall, though, it's a really good base from which to see all the sights in Hong Kong and I would recommend it.
