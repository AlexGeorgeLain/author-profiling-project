Hence we gave up trying to get the missing items from our order. Poor food, poor service.Very noisy room, very basic room. We lay straight on to a stained mattress no underblanket! HORRID.Breakfast although there were 4 staff in attendance we eventually sat at a dirty table, no-one came to clean it or offer us cutlery, we helped ourselves from behind the counter. Check- out we were charged 111euros for our room? No explanation except we were given a business room which is n ot advised, front on the hotel next to the noise and it is noisy!!! We were on a leisure trip as explained on arrival no rate given or indeed displayed anywhere behind reception. Watch out !Next letter is to the hotel to ask why!A POOR EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCE NOT TO BE REPEATED.
