Located inthe center of Mexico City nothing was too far but it is in a bit of a Metro dead zone. Nothing a ten minute walk couldn't solve. The room was smallish but very well appointed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We just took breakfast there but it was well prepared and very reasonable. Most of the guests seemed to be Mexican so the tourism buzz was very low key, which was nice.
