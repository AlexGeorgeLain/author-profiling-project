We had a fantastic time! We had no problem with check in. Our room, 271, was in a great location and our AC worked so well! The restaurants were good, not great but there was always something to eat. We loved the banana smoothies at breakfast and the mango in the main buffet in the Lobby. When we spoke to Antonio, Henry, or Miguel they always found mango for us, any time of day! They were awesome and really worked so hard. The only thing we were disappointed about was that there was no avocado. Not a big deal just thought I'd mention it. My 2 kids, 8 and 10, are picky eaters and always found something to eat! The beach was beautiful and as previously stated, huge! My husband and son enjoyed the free use of the catamaran and wished they had discovered them sooner. The pool was great and met a lot of nice people there! But the animation team was fantastic! They work so hard and are so much fun! My kids especially loved Cesar! He is very funny! My kids LOVED the mini disco in the evening before the show! We stayed for the shows everynight and no they are not broadway shows but they are entertaining! Every night they have a segment with audience participation and it is really funny. My husband had fun taking part in the show. We really had such a nice relaxing vacation and I would love to return next year! And we saw NO BUGS! Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
