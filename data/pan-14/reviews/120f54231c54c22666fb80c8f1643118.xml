It seemed REALLY tired, worn out and the rooms were small, cramped and the bed was like sleeping on a slab of rock cut out from the nearby Blue Mountains.. The fact that Sydney was experiencing over 100 millimetres of rain at the time didn't help the overall experience either!!My family and I stayed here for one night preparing for our international flight to Seoul the following day, and we're lucky we only had to spend one night here. Definatrely will be spending a bit extra to stay somewhere else next time we have to stay near the airport. We actually ate at the airport as well, skipping their restaurant :)I can't believe this hotel is rated 4 star by trip advisor, good to see all the other reviews on this site give similar ratings to mine :)Happy Travels.
