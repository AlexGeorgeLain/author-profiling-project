Pleasantly surprised by room size,not huge but adequate.Comfybeds and clean bathroom.What annoyed us was the noise levels from either side until the early hours,almost like they were in the room with you!! In a good location for seeing the sights.The hotel staff could do with brushing up on the surrounding area,as i asked directions to a well known restaraunt, and believe it or not the main bus station, and they could'nt tell me where either were.
