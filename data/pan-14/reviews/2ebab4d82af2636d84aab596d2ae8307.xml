Considering we experienced a sub tropical storm during our stay; the beach was beautiful and a very clean atmosphere overall. The shows at night were very entertaining and the disco bar was a lot of fun. The food, especially the french restaurant was amazing, by far the best restaurant at the resort. The drinks were tasty and the best part is that you were served while on the beach without even having to get up. The Sports Bar was a lot of fun, the bar tender there was our favorite. The trip was very well priced especially with all that was provided. We highly recommed this resort as the ultimate vacation package. The atmosphere, food and entertainment are well worth the reasonable price. We will defientely go back. This was the best trip we have been on!!!!
