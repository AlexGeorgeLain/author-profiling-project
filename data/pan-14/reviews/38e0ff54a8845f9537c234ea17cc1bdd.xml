We are experienced european travelers and have stayed at many 4/5 star hotels. In planning this trip we were uncertain about hotels but selected the Avendia. It was perfect: location within walking distance of the Gothic quarter as well as ALL other sites. Staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. It is rated4 star but this is a 5 star hotel at 2/3 star price.
