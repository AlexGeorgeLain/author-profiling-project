OUr agent recommended the Shangri La for the two nights we would be in SIngapore following our cruise. We paid for the Valley Wing which was the more exclusive accommodation and were told the price covered breakfast, afternoon tea, canapes and drinks in the evening. We had stayed at the Shangri La Hotel in Hong Kong and been very impressed with the wonderful hot nibbles that were offered on the buffet. We are not big drinkers but we did enjoy having the evening canapes that were freely on offer. However we soon discovered that the SL in Singapore was quite a different proposition. The breakfast was fine, no complaints there and we were never in the hotel during the afternoon tea hour. However when we arrived home from shopping and touring and went down to enjoy the canapes, we were suprised to be given merely one plate each with three very small and mostly cold offerings. No buffet as we had been expecting and a very stingy offering. Certainly it was nice to have the two glasses of wine we enjoyed but as far as the canapes went, that was it for the evening. After that we were told there were cookies available. Not very enjoyable with a glass of wine... Apart from that, our room was certainly large with a nice aspect but the bed was very very firm. Both my husband and I ended up having to take medication for our sore backs. We ordered room service one evening but the food was very ordinary and not worth the money. We ate a hundred times better at one of the food malls on Orchard Road. So, despite paying the extra for a Valley Wing room it was very disappointing and not worth the money. WOuldn't stay at the SL in Singapore again.
