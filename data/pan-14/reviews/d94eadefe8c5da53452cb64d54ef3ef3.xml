The room was next to an electrical generator which vibrated noisily --- and the air-conditioner was very loud. I asked for a room change and they put me in 321. I enjoy reading on vacation. There was no comfortable chair with an adjacent light. When I tried to read in bed, it slid away from the wall because it was on wheels. And the draperies were ripped. The third room had a chair, but no light next to it. So I shoved the chair into the entry area and read there. Overall, the rooms are dark. I thought the breakfasts were poorly presented, more like a diner. In the lunch restaurant, the service was terrible. The swimming pool is 6 x 10 feet and the lounge chairs there were taken most of the time. The bathrooms are very small. There was a nice porch where one could sit out and read or visit.The hotel building has great charm. The people working there are friendly. El Convento seems to me more like a three-star hotel. It is not luxurious, but pleasant. I thought $397 a night for a single was too much. I would not return.
