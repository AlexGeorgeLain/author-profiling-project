Don't bother looking in the book in the room...it is VERY outdated.Ordered room service - it was the wrong order and no silverware was on the tray.Breakfast staff was rude and it took over 20 minutes to order.They gave me written directions to return a rental car to the airport - the directions were wrong.What were the postitives? The check-in process was good, the front desk staff was friendly and thankfully I only had to stay 3 nights for a business trip.
