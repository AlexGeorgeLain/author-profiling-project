Normally we stay at another hotel on Bourbon St, but wanted a little quieter place. I booked with the hotels website and got a great rate. They gave us a standard room with two double beds. The room was very nice. I was worried that the room was going to be tiny because all of the reviews, but it was just like any other hotel room (two beds, nightstand, TV with stand and a few drawers, a desk, a nice comfy chair with ottoman and even a closet). We did not eat in the restaurants or order room service. The pool was very nice and the view was spectacular. The people working at the rooftop bar were great! The only think that we could complain about was that there a soda machine in the hotel to get a late night drink. One of the other reviews complained of too much water pressure, it is strong, but you will be fine.The location is great. You are a block from bourbon and a can get to everything by walking. We had a great time and will return.
