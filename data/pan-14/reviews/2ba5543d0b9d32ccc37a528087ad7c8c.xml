From the moment we walked in the front door to check in, we loved it. The staff were very friendly helpful, the room was very clean, we liked the location, the coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the morning the wine/beer happy hour from 5pm-6pm was great!We stayed in a part bay view room on the 8th floor. We had noise from the air conditioner units from the restaurant next door but we walked so much through the day that we slept through it! Next time we stay I will request a room with a full bay view.It rained all weekend we still walked everywhere. It's not that far a walk from Union Square it's all flat with no hills. We would recommend this hotel to most people. I wouldn't take kids though.

The only few good things was the location, the room size the staff were very friendly. The bed was as hard as a rock the shower was dirty. It took us 2 calls to downstairs for them to give us the correct password to get the free internet access to work. Once we got the correct password, it worked fine.
