The many luxurious cars gives a glamorous feeling. The restaurants are outstanding and deserve a Michelin Star or two.The rooms are luxuriously decorated with all the latest technology. If comes with a price tag and not everyone can afford it. Hotel seems selective in choice of guests and that keeps it a true brilliant in Hong Kong. It is definetly the place to be and to be seen.I am looking forward for the W hotel to open as well. Will try it once they open their doors.
