My sheets smelled like mildew, as a result of the dampness of the room, and I believe I may have been bitten by a bedbug or two during my week stay. Guest services were not the least bit accommodating to our large group of 11. The buffet was pretty decent, but of course like most things on this trip, it could have been better. One major difficulty was the majority of employees at the resort who spoke very little English, hence non-effective communication throughout our entire stay. The highlight of this trip were the off-site excursions, but even these were ill-planned and slightly disorganized. I'm sure there have been many satisfied guests here, but I certainly am not one. I would rate this resort @ a 5 out of 10 and would not recommend it to anyone travelling to Punta Cana.
