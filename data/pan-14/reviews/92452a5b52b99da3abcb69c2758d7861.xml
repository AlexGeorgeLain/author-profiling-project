I stayed here in January for 8 days and just now got around to writing a review because I've been traveling for work as usual. I loved it, and that's pretty much all there is to say.But I'll say more. Upon check-in, a dairk haired female was so polite and used my name several times. She said Welcome back, since I had stayed there once this year and have a Hilton membership. She offered me an upgrade, and a bellman promptly walked me to my room.The room was open and airy. The bed linens were crisp, and I took a nap before my first meeting. I ordered a cesar salad from room service after that, and the agent was also very nice. The food at this place wsa great throughout my stay. One day for breakfast I had the eggs benedict, and it reminded me of a dish I once had in my childhood.Upon checkout, over the phone, the guy asked me how my stay was. Housekeeping was great I said, the staff was all friendly, and my room was comfortable. I didn't want to go back to GA.
