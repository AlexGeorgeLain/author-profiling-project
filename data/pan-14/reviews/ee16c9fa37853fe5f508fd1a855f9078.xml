I love the views from the rooms and the Rise Bar but the service has definitely eroded over the last year. Some examples from my last (two day) stay: (1) two days of cold showers and when I complained I received a simple really? with no follow up (2) the shoe shine service failed to actually shine my shoes (they just stayed hung on my door overnight even though I called ahead) and (3) the breakfast I ordered came 45 minutes earlier than I requested. This just isn't acceptable for this level of hotel.I'd suggest staying at the St. Regis midtown unless you absolutely must stay near the financial district.
