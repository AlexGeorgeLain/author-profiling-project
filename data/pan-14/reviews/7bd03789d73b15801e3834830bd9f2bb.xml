Have stayed in Marina Mandarin a few times on business so knew it was in a great location - very central for a number of attractions and for the shopping but did not anticipate the high prices they were charging even taking into account the xmas and new year period. Facilities are great although rooms smaller than I'd expect for a hotel of this price in this part of the world and in-room facilities are spartan in comparison to other chains. Breakfast buffet is reminiscent of feeding time at the zoo when the hotel is at full capacity as it was during my stay. Such a crush of people meant long queues, a constant lack of something on the buffet table and poor service. Calls to the service desk on this issue went unanswered.Staff are friendly and everything works - the hotel does however lack a real identity but given the high turnover of folk and the size of the place, this is to be expected. Good access to malls/entertainment/MRT/taxis and overall a good hotel althouigh if I were staying again I have decided to stay in the suburbs, save at least $100 per night on room price, commute instead by taxi into town and have an additional $100 to spend on goodies.
