We stayed room only so can't comment on the food.The place is decaying a bit with the odd light fitting askew in the lobby, one of the elevators out of action, and the other one's handrail secured by a bit of wire. Reception staff were efficient but seemed a little disinterestedThe rooms were neat and clean and the plumbing mostly worked OK. Couldn't fault the maid service.Only 5 mins walk from the Ramblas.We were quite happy with our choice and thought it good value for money
