I am a Hilton Honors member and was pleasantly surprised that I received and upgrade beyond belief! I had a suite on top of a hill and it was so spacious that I was flabbergasted. That is the good news...the bad news is that finding the room was more than a tad difficult. The outside lighting is poor, the streets are not really streets (more like alleys) and the room I was in (26 something) was in building number 25...go figure. The place is not ADA compliant so I had to hike up to my room hauling my wheeled luggage behind me. I called my wife and told her that I did not work out on the trreadmill that day but got a workout just hauling the bag up to the room! The cell phone did not work in the room so I ran up a small bill using the hotel phone. The food was excellent at the lunch and breakfast I had and the people were very nice. I would go here again but I would have my bag delivered.
