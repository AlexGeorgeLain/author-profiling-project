It is decorated nicely and our room was a good size, as was the bathroom. The breakfast was bread, pastries, cereals, etc., and very good cappuccinos. It is a short walk to the Accademia, and the rest of the tourist attractions are a walkable distance, but we were told the buses went by frequently, if you want to walk. There seem to be any restaurants, etc., in the immediate area around the hotel, which may bother some people. The big plus for this hotel was its pleasant and informative staff. Each one was very courteous and helpful. The desk clerk and the two of us were the only ones up at 5:30AM when she called a cab for us. The cab came in 5 minutes. Now service!
