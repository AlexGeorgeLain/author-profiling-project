The airport in Punta Cana is an open air airport, pretty cool and easy to manuver through.We upgraded to the Elite Club when we booked and felt for the four days it was worth it. We had Room 6103 in the Elite Club villa. It was a beautiful room with a king size canopy bed, chaise lounge and the bathroom was HUGE with double sinks, separate jacuzzi tub and tons of marble. We always had plenty of towels and they were changed daily. The Elite suite offers a fruit basket upon checkin, along with 3 cigars, premimum liquor, stocked fridge, robes, slippers, beach towels. The Elite check in was quick and smooth and I had a glass of champagne while waiting to check in. (in fact I had a lot of champagne during the whole trip)...The pool is actually two large pools separated by a hot tub, both with their own swim up bar. The people were cleaning the pools all the time.The beach is spectacular. White soft sand and blue water...completely awesome. Plenty of chairs.Food was really good, steak house and italian were really good. There is an extra cost for the steak house. Buffet was fresh and plenty to chose from. The grounds were clean and very pretty.There is a casino on site, didn't spend much time there. The sport's bar was good and they have Corona and waitress service outside. Mike's coffee was AWESOME..great cappacino and cheesecake.The employees were awesome and very friendly. Had a massage at the Spa...loved it (actually caught myself drooling)...I highly recommend it and go with an open mind. If you look for flaws, I am sure that you find them...but I thought this hotel was good for the price.Any questions, email me.
