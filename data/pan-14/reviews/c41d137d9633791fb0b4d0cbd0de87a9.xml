We booked the hotel via Hotwire since it was advertised as Union Square West. What Hotwire doesn't tell you is that west of Union Square is The Tenderloin which is the most crime ridden neighborhood in San Francisco. We never entered the hotel because we did not want to stay in that neighborhood. Still fighting with Hotwire to get my money back but I'd rather lose the money than risk the safety of my girlfriend and property. If I didn't have my girlfriend or a car with me, I might have stayed there. For downtown San Francisco, it is a bargain. But you get what you pay for.
