I travel 3 or 4 days per week on the average so to say the least I was extremely satisfied with this hotel. We booked a normal room and where upgraded to a suite with a bay view. I am sure this was because I am a Hilton Diamond. The breakfast on the Executive floor was outstanding. Also do not miss the drinks and finger foods starting at 5:30 pm. The staff at the hotel bring you to your room upon arrival and get you acquanited with the hotel. Nice touch! We stayed for three nights and wished it cold have been longer. Take the Airport Express train from the airport and then go to #1 bus at the Central station. This is the easiest and fastest way to get to hotel. Our room was just finished being remodeled. I recommend this hotel to business or leisure traveller.The concierge recommeded the Hu Tong restaurant on Kowloon side for dinner. This restuarant has to be on your list of MUST DO when in Hong Kong. Try and have dinner during the 8 pm time slot to watch the light show on other side of bay.We stayed here as part of our 20th wedding anniversary.Richard and Emily
