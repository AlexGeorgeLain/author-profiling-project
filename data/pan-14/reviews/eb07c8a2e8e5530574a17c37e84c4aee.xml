Excellent dining facilities, excellent staff. I usually stay at the Hilton but between the pro-bowl and multiple conventions no openings where available. The Ilikai was a very pleasant surprise. No complaints what so ever.In conversation with the bar staff it was reveiled that the hotel is being sold as of April.
