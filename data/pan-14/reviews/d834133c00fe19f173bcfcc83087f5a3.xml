I booked for 2 of us by checking the Expedia/Travelocity rates...then, took advantage of Kimpton's website guarantee to match low rates and top with a free room upgrade. We got Jefferson King suites facing courtyard...each suite is 2 large, high-ceilinged rooms with good-size bath and 6' tub. Tons of seating, honor bar mini-fridge, 2 TVs...amazingly comfy bed. Other 2 families in our group booked elsewhere for less square footage at twice the price.July heatwave, but we had A/C (admittedly, it struggled a bit for the 2 large rooms, but not uncomfortable.) Hotel is older, but has been updated with new carpet, paint, wallpaper, and upholstery...spotless throughout.PERFECT location...you can walk to theatres, Union Square, Chinatown, or Civic Ctr area...even Embarcadero. North Beach (uphill) is a little stretch, but streetcars and cable cars are within a block or two for Fisherman's Wharf, etc. Try Lefty O'Douls on Geary for a great hot breakfast under $7.Maids, concierge, desk clerk...even maintenance guy...all VERY friendly and just like family to us. Continental bkfst is $6.50 if you want the cereal/juice/pastries, but coffee hot tea is free. Free wine and focaccia bread from 5-6pm...even book reviews onsite each Wednesday. EXCELLENT service...I would not think of staying elsewhere unless another Kimpton in the same area if this one is booked.
