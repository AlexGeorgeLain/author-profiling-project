The beach was beautiful, plenty of chairs and trees to read under, weather was absolutely amazing, 85 with slight wind blowing all the time. The activites were there, we just chose to watch and read. We would definitely return and just stay longer. The GO's were so nice and friendly and very helpful in making the trip our best ever!
