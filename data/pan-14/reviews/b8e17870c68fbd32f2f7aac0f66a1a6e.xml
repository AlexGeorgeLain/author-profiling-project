The staff were helpful and courteous and our room small but adequate. We were not bothered by street noise (although there were some inconsiderate guests with loud voices in the halls) and we were pleased to find free internet access. The hotel was within walking distance of everything we wished to see and with a call in advance to the hotel they arranged reserved entry to the Academia and other galleries. There was a surcharge for this but we were told when we booked and had no complaints. Overall we all were very pleased with our stay and would have no hesitation at all in recommending it or staying there on a return trip.
