We opened the door to our corner room on the 1st floor and the room was spotless with a clear view of the Eiffel Tower. We arrived after midnight and the guy at the front desk was very welcoming. His English was ok but he had said that breakfast was included in our price. Apparently it wasn't since at check out, we noticed breakfast was tacked on to our final amount. And at quite a hefty price too. That was the only issue though. Not sure on the size of the other rooms, but the corner rooms are generously sized (ask for a room that ends with a 5 which are the corner rooms). The shower/sink is separate from the toilet, but both were very clean. The Metro is just 2 blocks away (Ecole Militaire stop) and there are a couple cafes along the street. There is quite a bit of street/traffic noise during the day, but the windows actually do a great job in minimizing it. We had a hard time finding the street upon arrival so make sure you have good directions, perhaps from the hotel. Overall, had an excellent stay at the Duquesne.
