Having booked online slightly apprehensive about what the accommodation would be like - we needn't have worried! Absolutely gorgeous hotel, excellent service, spotlesss rooms, incredibly helpful staff. Dined at the hotel twice during our short stay and the food was sensational and fantastic value. Would recommend this hotel without hesitation. Location a short walk from the harbour - coldn't have been more pleased with our choice.
