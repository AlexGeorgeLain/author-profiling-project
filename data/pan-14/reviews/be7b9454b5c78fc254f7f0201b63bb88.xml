We had five days here and I have to say it was fantastic.The hotel had organised a limo to pick us up from the airport - most welcome after a 15 hour flight - and from there we never looked back. The room was large and clean, breakfast was healthy and fresh and the recommendations of the owner / manager were all spot on (especially the secret cocktail bar at the top end of the street!!!).We would definitely go back as the location was perfect close enough to the city to walk, but far enough away to experience true Sydney life.
