We liked almost everything about it, from the renovated room with a very big and well equipped kitchenette to the red apples always available in the lobby. The complimentary breakfast is more european (juice, muffin/scone, fruit), but there was also great coffee in our room during our stay.Both of our rooms were recently renovated, the flat screen TV was large and we liked the modern asian-inspired decor. The bathrooms were smallish, but on the other hand we liked the quality of the cosmetic products.Most of all, we enjoyed the location. For paying 90$ per night for a studio room (not too big, but enough for us), we were in central Waikiki, two blocks from the beach! We were especially thankful for the free internet (via cable in the room, wireless in the lobby). The staff was nice and helpful. The garden with the pool looked good if rather small, but since we were close to the beach we never really used it. Maybe the only complaint we could note was the street noise at night (our balcony faced the street in the direction of the beach).In conclusion, next time we are in Oahu on a budget, we will probably want to stay in an Aqua hotel.
