The price is right, the location is great, and it is very laid back!Not a bad Mexican Restaurant between hotel and the beach, Hawaiian food is not the best unless you have a strange craving for Spam.

The breakfast was very ordinary. The best thing is the location , right in the heart of Old San Juan. I was last in San Juan in 1967 so I saw a big change.It is sad that you cannot get a beer in a glass, ( some places will not let you drink out of the bottle ) because of a local habit of smashing the glass in your face. On reflection I suppose the plastic cup was the way to go!
