They run a free bus shuttle to the city, fine for shopping but pain if you only want to go out to eat. Only advantage is it is outside the congestion charge area so taxi from the aiport was just S$20. However we stayed here for one night as we understood it was the connection for the MAS bus to Senai Airport. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE. We asked at reception and they just said it was now cancelled and gave no assistance on alternative transport.You actually get a taxi from a special stand in the city centre to Johor Baru and then they arrange a second taxi to Senai. S$60.Can see no other reason to stay here.
