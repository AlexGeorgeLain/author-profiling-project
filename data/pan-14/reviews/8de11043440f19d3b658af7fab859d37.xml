We had very a large room (large kitchen area with table, bedroom area with 2 queens and a sofa bed) at the back of the motel on the top floor - which unlike the previous reviewers room had a panoramic view over the city (not the courtyard) we could even see the top of the Golden Gate bridge though I believe we had the only room with this view. The decor was perhaps a little dated but all was clean. No problems with TV or phone and free wireless Internet was huge bonus for daughter who wanted to catch up with her friends back home. We found the location excellent for us, walking distance to most things and SF public transport is excellent. We avoided breakfast at the hotel completely and went to Polkers on Polk Street (as recommended by the staff) for superb breakfasts (pancakes, waffles etc etc etc you name it they do it), we also had an evening meal there which was also excellent and very good value.We found the staff at Nob Hill were very welcoming and friendly (despite having to wait up late for us due to a cancelled flight) They were extremely helpful giving us lots of local info, places to see (areas to avoid) etc.If I was to give a couple of tips for staying in San Francisco they would be avoid Fishermans wharf unless you like really touristy trash and if you want to make the trip to Alcatraz in the summer book it before you go - we hadn't done this and found all the trips were booked up for the whole week.

We (my husband and I and two teenage children) stayed at the Affinia 50 in July. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our 15th floor suite was extremely clean and large enough for 2 queen beds and a rollaway bed for our second daughter, the bathroom was a good size and there was more than adequate closet space. The kitchen was usful, but not really necessary as there are so many places to eat nearby. As a previous reviewer said the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept on (I have back problems and I'm very very fussy), we did reciveve a pillow menu but didn't bother to change. We had no problems with noise from banging doors or voices in corridoors and street noise was at a perfectly acceptable level for a busy city (again noise is an area about which we are a fussy family as we take particular care to be quiet ourselves). All the staff were extremely helpful giving us recommndations for things to do, places to go, places to eat and directions. Would definately stay here again.Highly recommend Ess-a-bagel across the street for breakfast, and the Smith and Wollensky grill (on 49th and 3rd) for excellent steak.
