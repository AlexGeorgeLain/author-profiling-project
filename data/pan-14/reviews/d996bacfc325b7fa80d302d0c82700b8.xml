Until it was daytime during the week, you could not hear ANY noise in the room - it was silent. Even during construction, the rooms were immaculate, the staff was as nice as ever (I have stayed here for the past 6 years), and breakfast was bountiful and fresh. I know that there are homeless people living in other countries in nice areas on the street, so I was surprised to see the negative comments about the homeless people. This exists in nice areas in NY, Chicago, New Orleans, and every other major US City. As for not worth the money or too expensive, I am not sure what discount website you are looking at for the West Hollywood area, but if you can find a wonderful hotel like Elan in West Hollywood for even close to their low rates, PLEASE let me know, as I search every year, and can't find anything close to their prices. The nice hotel down the block by the Beverly Center is about 3 times the price of the Elan. I am not aware of a better value in West Hollywood, than the Elan Hotel. Bob ZelinOrlando, FL.
