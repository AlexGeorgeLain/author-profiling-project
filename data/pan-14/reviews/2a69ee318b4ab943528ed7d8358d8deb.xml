There is a skylight, but that will not tell you what the weather is like outside. The room is clean and comfortable but without windows it tends to be claustrophobic. The bathroom is beautiful, very modern and well appointed. The beds are comfortable. The breakfast which was included in the package was satisfactory but not exceptional. Warning, the elevator does not go to the floor on which this room is located, you will have to walk up three short flights of steps to get there from the 3rd floor landing. The hotel is walking distance from most of the major attractions in Florence but there is a decided lack of good restaurants in the area. The staff were friendly and mostly spoke reasonable English.
