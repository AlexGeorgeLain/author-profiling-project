After ages of looking and trying 3 different other room types we got upgraged to the Business Rooms on the top floor (needed to use room key card to access the floor), Result! The Business Floor gives you free unlimited access to the Internet and very spacious rooms in the main building. Free fridge and In room safe. The Hotel is only 5 min walk brings you to the heart of Fishermans Warf and within walking distance of the other piers. China Town and Lombard Street (crookedy street) is up hill so suggest using the trams or taxi.The only rude people were the bar staff, but at least there was free nibbles (srimp/calamari) to enjoy while you had a relaxing drink. The Hotel has a Denny Restaurant inside the second building. Overall this hotel was clean well, looked after and would definately stay here again.
