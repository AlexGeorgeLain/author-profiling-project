The management couldn't have been more helpful, particularly David Foschi, the reception manager who did everything possible to make our stay as comfortable and convenient as possible.The first floor of the hotel has recently been refurbished, Tuscan style, and these rooms are sizeable and beautifully appointed - very stylish and in keeping with the area.The position of the hotel is perfect - right by the Palazzo Vecchio and Uffizi Gallery, 2 minutes from the Ponte Vecchio and 3 minutes from the Duomo - but despite its central location it manages to be very peaceful - with a cool (in all senses) bar to retreat to.Great, historical breakfast room with great big and varied breakfasts - and a lovely little roof terrace if you want to chill out for a bit, several floors above the Florentine hubbub.I'm normally hypercritical of hotels (see review on Villa del Quar) but I can't speak highly enough of this one. This is the only place I would ever stay again on further visits to Florence.
