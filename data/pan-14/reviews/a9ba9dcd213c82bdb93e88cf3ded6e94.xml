We are a mature couple who like to explore on foot, getting the real flavour of a city, its people and culture so we tend to research the location where we wish to stay thoroughly. We describe ourselves as backpackers at heart who have matured to enjoy reasonably comfortable accommodation. We chose Raco del Pi because it is conveniently located in the old city (Barrio Gotic) with narrow alleys and streets, surrounded by reasonable quality, low cost restaurants and close to Las Ramblas, subway etc and a short walk to the Plaza Catalunya shopping precinct and open top bus routes.The hotel staff were always helpful and enjoyed the welcome class of champagne on arrival. We always request a quiet room and they obliged, with the street noise from mainly foot traffic disappearing by mid evening. The room was reasonably large, bathroom was clean, a fridge in the room and air conditioned. The room was serviced daily and whilst our chosen price range does not provide 5 star sparkle, the hotel was clean and comfortable with a good shower. We will return to Raco del Pi without hesitation.
