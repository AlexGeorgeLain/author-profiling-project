The hotel restaurant was still under construction when I stayed, but it looked like it would be nice. The room was comfortable (it was a little dark), and the flat-panel HD TV delighted my husband to no end! The round-the-clock Tully's coffee in the lobby was great to offset the horrible freezing rain we had to deal with. The excercise room is fantastic, with top-of-the-line equipment - bring your headphones to watch tv in the console monitors. The location is terrible unless you are only in town for a sporting event. There are homeless people sleeping in nearby doorways, and almost nothing around the hotel. We walked the distance to Pike's Market (walkable in good weather), but there are several blocks of empty buildings that aren't welcoming, and I wouldn't have walked it alone. The parking is EXPENSIVE, but there's nowhere else to park unless you want to leave your car in an unattended (dubious looking) lot. The staff was very nice, though, and the continental breakfast was acceptable (there's nowhere else to get breakfast nearby, so you might as well eat there).
