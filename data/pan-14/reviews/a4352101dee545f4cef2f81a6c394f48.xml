I stayed in room 207 (the crash pad), which was a small but beautiful room. Being someone who lives in a very small studio apartment, I thought they really made GREAT use of the space. On my last night, it was too cold and rainy to go out, so I stayed in and watched a movie and I felt like I was at home. The staff downstairs was very helpful, and were always eager to help gave perfect directions to the airport using the mass transit (which only costs me 2.75 where a cab ride would have been 40-50 dollars).The Hotel is right near the 24 hour streetcar on Queen Street, which is a hotspot for restaurants, galleries, shopping, and near several ZipCars. For the young Carless city-dwellers, this is a perfect location to stay when visiting Toronto!The only 2 reasons I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because I had to pay a cover charge to get into the bar downstairs (Which I thought was a little lame, especially when I'm staying there). Though the room was very quiet, there was a low buzzing hum you could hear and feel during certain times of the night and the morning in bed that made me grateful that I brought my earplugs with me.
