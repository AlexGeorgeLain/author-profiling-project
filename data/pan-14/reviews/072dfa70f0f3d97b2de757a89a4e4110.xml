It was a very nice size. ..two rooms (small but still roomy by Paris standards)..a little kitchenette with a microwave and refridgerator. The only thing missing was a coffee pot (we bought a French Press and it solved the issue)...The room was kept very clean..and we mostly had breakfast brought to our room which was juice, coffee, and pastry or bread..it was plenty for us..we aren't big morning eaters.The area was quiet, and we really had nothing to complain about. The staff were helpful and the trains were nearby.
