The location is perfect because it allows easy access to all of Amsterdam, but sits on a quiet street.The hotel offers a nutritious full breakfast that can fuel you for a great start to a busy day in Amsterdam.The rooms are perfectly clean with sufficient storage and closets. The staff are helpful, with everyone understanding English.I would stay here again if I returned to Amsterdam.
