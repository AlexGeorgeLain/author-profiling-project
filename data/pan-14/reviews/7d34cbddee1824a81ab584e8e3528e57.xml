It was perfect - the room was well equiped and the staff were charming and helpful. How they all knew our name was astonishing. Handy for the star ferry and kowloon shopping. We stayed in a Horizon harbour view room - well worth the extra - magnificent view over the harbour and a lovely lounge with coffee, soft drinks and nibbles all day with a happy 2 hours with complementary alcohol and hot snacks in the evening, plus a most excellent complimentary breakfast. All in all couldn't fault it at all and will certainly stay there on our next Hong Kong trip

Has spoiled us for anywhere else. The prices are eye watering especially with the current state of the pound but you get what you pay for.A couple of details - the breakfasts are superb - mixture of western and eastern stuff with a daily special - and of course marvellous views.The pool - constant supplies of iced water with regular rounds of frozen watermellon and sobet served by charming young men.The tamal wantalan restaurant - magnificant italian food. the concierge - incredibly helpful re trips etc.minor niggle - when you are paying this much to stay there charging extra for wi fi does seem a bit petty. We had intended to see a lot of bali but appart from two trips - to the volcano and uluwata we spent most of the time at the pool.Tip - the seafood cafes 200 yards along the beach were excellent and avoided us bankrupting ourselves at the hotel restaurants.
