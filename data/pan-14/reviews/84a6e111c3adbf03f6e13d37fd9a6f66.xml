Unfortunately we got a room on the 4th floor with barely a view to speak of, but thats minor really. The best bit was breakfast in the Twist bar. Pancakes, waffles, danish , toast, fruit, cereals, all the fried stuff and a complimentary smoothie. Fantastic. OK, so the hotel is great but the location if you dont have a car is not good at all. Do not go to LA if you dont have wheels because its so large and spread out and the public transport is pointless. Although you have the chinese theatre outside, thats it. I wouldnt walk about in this area alone, especially at night and to get anywhere else is an expensive cab ride away. If you can afford it, stay in Beverly Hills. Much nicer.
