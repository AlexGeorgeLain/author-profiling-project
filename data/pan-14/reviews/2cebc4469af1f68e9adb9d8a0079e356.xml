This place is in no way luxurious, and as has been pointed out by several reviewers, rather old. However I still find it really pleasant to stay here because the place has everything that you would need for a comfortable, relaxing stay. You will find a restaurant that serves traditional American food, regular and reliable room service, a clean swimming pool, fairly large rooms each with an ample-sized balcony, friendly staff... honestly I cannot really think of what else to ask for! I sometimes wish that there were fewer of those entertainment events in early evenings by the pool, but even they do not go on and on forever. In short, it all works here at the sportsmens.
