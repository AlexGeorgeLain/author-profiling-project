As a family with two young children, we love the location, spacious family rooms, friendly staff (Gede is a good guide and the best driver! - he is located out the front), and wonderful spa/massage treatments all on-site. The hotel is right across from the Bali Dynasty. There is a good money exchanger across the road right next to a small supermarket - it is also not a far walk from the Centro Shopping Centre and Waterbom Park. We will be back next year!
