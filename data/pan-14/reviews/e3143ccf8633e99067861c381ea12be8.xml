The hotel was top notch as was the service. The rooms were quite spacious compared to other hotels i've stayed at in NY. My package included champange and strawberries upon arrival and full breakfast for 2 in bed. It was quite luxurious. I was very pleased with the room, amenities, staff, views of NY from my room and every detail of my short stay. I would definitely reccommend and stay again in the future.
