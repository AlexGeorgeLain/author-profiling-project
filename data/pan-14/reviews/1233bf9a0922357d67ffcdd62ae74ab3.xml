Breakfast should have been included in the price. Our in-room coffee maker was dirty (white material floating in the freshly made coffee and inside the water tank). Made complaint to management, took till next day and another complaint in order to obtain clean coffee maker. In the meantime, went to breakfast area for only coffee and would have been charged for two complete buffets but did not sign the receipt. The final hotel bill did contain the buffet charges and had an unpleasant discussion with management to get it resolved in our favor. Three people were in our room, requested an extra towel and it took another call the next day to receive service. The location is good, clean hotel but we would not stay there again. Parking was free for hotel guests, good point. Smoking in public areas should be banned.
