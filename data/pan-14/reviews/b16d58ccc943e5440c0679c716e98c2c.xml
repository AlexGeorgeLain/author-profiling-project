One of the best hotels I've stayed in Singapore. The staff were courteous, efficient and helpful. I receive a complimentary birthday cake by surprise. The pools were clean. Breakfast was good. Good location. Rooms spacious and luxurious. Absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended!

I stayed there for two nights as a stopover on the way to Oz. I wanted to treat myself, so i thought what the heck? The really go the extra mile for their customers. For example, they contacted the airport about my lost luggage without even me asking. They also opened the breakfast diner 20 mins earlier because i had an early flight to catch! Now, i wasn't even staying in a suite, just a standard room. The one problem i have about this property is that it's quite hard to get to. It's not very close to any MRT stations. But that's all. I highly recommend it.
