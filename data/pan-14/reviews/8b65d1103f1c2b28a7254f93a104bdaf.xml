The hotel is new and set in pleasant gardens. The rooms were very clean,decorated and furnished to a high standard. There is an hotel restaurant which is expensive and other guests said that the price of drinks from the bar were high . We arrived early evening feeling a bit peckish there are restaurants and an all night garage selling snacks across the road. However crossing the road is quite a challenge. We had breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant which was buffet style with a good selection of food it cost $18 which I thought was expensive.
