As soon as we walked in the front door we were greeted with a warm reception. The room I requested was #43 facing the front of the hotel and over looking the Marina both the bedroom and bathroom were large and very clean when we return we will stay here again. The staff was very helpful and spoke very good english. Ask for a room in the front as the rear rooms face a building and are some what smaller. Great loacation a short walk to the La Rambla and the Picasso Museum.
