Great location for business and near all Spring Training facilities in the west side of Phoenix. University of Phoenix Stadium, where the Cardinals play football is just 15 minutes away. This side of the valley has grown and has much to offer the traveler. The Westgate center, right next to the stadium has it all! This place has all amenities for the business traveler and leisure guests. I heard they are under contruction for a brand new lobby bar and will include the Link@Sheraton. The link is a great gathering area to do work on your laptop and printing services while enjoying a cup of Starbucks Coffee. I was blown away with the service the staff provided! This hotel gets it in this economy on how they treat their guests. I didnt get that at the nearby hotels during other business trips. I felt at home and welcomed as soon as i walked in. I would recommend The Sheraton Crescent Hotel.
