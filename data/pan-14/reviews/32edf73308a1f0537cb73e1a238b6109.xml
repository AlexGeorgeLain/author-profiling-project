Front desk staff were helpful and friendly, and the room was nicely furnished with a very comfortable bed and excellent show. Parisien hotel rooms are never going to be very large and this room was no exception, but there was room either side of the double bed and the bathroom was far from cramped.I loved the free wireless internet and internet on the BO television, but it was a pity that certain English language television stations were not working. Only CNN was available.I did not have breakfast at the hotel, so cannot comment on that.Although my room was at the front of the hotel on the 3rd floor, it was not at all noisy from outside. The road on which the hotel sits is quiet and residential. The wooden floorboards meant that there was some noise from above when people walked around with their shoes on. I guess that might have been annoying if I had been there for a long time but for two nights was no big deal.The nearby metro station is very well connected to the network, and although this hotel is not smack bang in the middle of the city it is very easy to get everywhere in Paris that you might want to go.I was very impressed and would certainly return to this hotel.
