It is situated directly above the train station and entry to the hotel is via a lift (elevator) situated inside the station, (on north side of station ground level), but it's not as easy to find as it could be. The rooms have ADSL. Whilst they claim the rooms are soundproof, they are not; however, they are quiet. Lots of road works going on (6/07), but tour buses stop across the street and it's easy to get to main part of town if you have a map. Beds are not as cofortable as they could be. We fixed that by putting blankets under the sheet and then we were fine. Bathroom is large and bright enough to do makeup. Did not try inhouse restaurant, but lots of others did. They also have a car park in case you need it.
