Hotel is clean and updated. Wired LAN in the rooms is expensive, but access for 1hr at a time is free. The hotel is a short walk from the U2 U-bahn line, Spittelmarkt station. This made getting around town very easy. Workout room is very small with just a small selection of treadmills and stair climbers, but better than nothing. Hotel staff was helpful with maps and even have some jogging/running route suggestions.
