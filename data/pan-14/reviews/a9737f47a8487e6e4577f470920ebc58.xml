Vincci Soho is very well located on the cusp of Bourbon Madrid and Historic Old Madrid, a stone throw away from Plaza Santa Anna. It is chic, with quite a number of lounge areas, each of which uniquely decorated to enhance the contemporary and minimalist feel of the hotel. The rooms are large, with thoughtful decor, not overwhelming, but just the right amount of touch. Amenities were plentiful, and our floor window opened to a narrow local street, giving a feel of authentic Spanish living. The breakfast buffet was very original with an emphasis on local flavors and a wide selection of fruits and juices, far better than the ones we got from some of the Paradores we stayed at. I would highly recommend Vincci Soho to anyone who ventures into Madrid.
