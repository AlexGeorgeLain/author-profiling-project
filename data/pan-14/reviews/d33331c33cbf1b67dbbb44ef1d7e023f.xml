Great location in the Latin Quarter. The neighborhood has restaurants and taverns galore...some at fairly reasonable prices, so you can easily pop in after a long day of sightseeing. And you are literally one block away from taking a train, subway or bus anywhere in the city and beyond. Would recommend, even though at times, noise from the street did drift in a bit, and the beds were a bit narrow, but that's just an aside for those who care. Enjoy Paris!
