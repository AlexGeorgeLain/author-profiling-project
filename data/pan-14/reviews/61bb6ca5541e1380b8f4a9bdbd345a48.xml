We had a partial ocean view room on the 7th floor, which meant that our balcony had view of both the rain forest and the ocean. The property was pretty empty during the week which was great for us. The food was expensive but tasty, our favorite was the new Aqua Luna cafe which let us bring our own wine with no corking charge. The hotel grounds were beautiful and the beach was basically deserted with nice swimming. However it can't compare to the beach at Culbrera -definitely worth a day trip! We took the bio bay tour through the hotel $160 for two and it was definitely worth it. We rented a car (a must) and did the rest of our sightseeing on our own - San Juan, rainforest, Culbrera. We also would recommend both Las Vegas (by the rainforest) and Richie's (at the top of the hill above the resort) for off site food. We requested a mini fridge when we arrived and were told that they were all out. However, the fridge arrived the following day with a fruit plate and bottle of wine as an apology. We found that all of the staff were very pleasant and quite helpful. We also took the shuttle to the casino for an evening and found it to be a nice trip out (especially since we won and needed a distraction from our snorkeling sunburn). Overall this was a great experience and we would definitely return. The resort is a great location to tour eastern PR, however if you are looking for lots of nightlife this isn't the place. But, if you are looking to see PR and enjoy a tropical vacation in a beautiful place you can't go wrong with this resort!
