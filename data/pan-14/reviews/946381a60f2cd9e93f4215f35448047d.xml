The hotel is a period mansion, beautifully decorated and in a nice spot, just on the outskirts of town.The room was a good size, with high panelled ceilings, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The furniture appeared period and totally suited the room, with lots of storage space.The bathroom was also a good size, with a powerful walk-in shower.Remote control aircon is included, as is a digital safe.All the staff were very friendly and helpful - advising on things like local transport and restaurants etc.The buffet breakfast was lovely - cereal, yoghurt, fresh croissants/bread rolls, fresh fruit/cocktail and Italian savouries/sweets - enough to keep you going well into the afternoon. Happy hour is not to be missed if you can help it - free wine and snacks in the garden every night!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to come back.
