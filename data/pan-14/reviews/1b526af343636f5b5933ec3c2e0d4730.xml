Didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the meals.Good location though, very close to Copley Sq, the Pru and the public Library. Loads of eating/drinking places around with a good value food court in the bottom of the Pru centre.Hotel seems to be trading on its past glories a little but I would stay here again - providing I can get a good internet rate!

		<document id="7172caa70af65317139d6d169af392a5" url=""><![CDATA[Good but not great Best thing about the hotel is the location - bang opposite Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market and almost on the Freedom Trail.Our room was on the 7th floor at the back overlooking the Holocaust Memorial. The room was clean and of an ok size but the furniture was a bit tatty and it needed sprucing up. Bathroom was fine.Hotel was very expensive to eat or drink in (and the mini-bar was a real rip-off). Easy solution - walk over the road to Quincy Market and you have over 75 eating places to choose from, with prices ranging from the dirt cheap to moderately expensive (avoid the Rustic Kitchen!).I would stay at the hotel again but only because of its location and the cheap internet deals you can get. Don't pay full rate.
