I was fortunate enough to be able to use my Starwood points, so I didn't need to count the euros. Service was excellent at check in and departure, and our room was comparable to the Meridien in the US. The hotel has recently been renovated and everything looked new. The beds were comfortable and faced a 50 inch plasma TV on the opposite wall. The bathtub was huge, and had a rubber incline so you could lean back comfortably. And of course, a separate shower. Bath amenities were the same that I used to get at the Meridien in Beverly Hills.The hotel location was right on the Ramblas, only a block or two from the Plaza de Catalunya. There were cabs galore, and a convenient metro too.All in all, a great place to have has your home base in a beautiful city.

The location around the Metro Center mall in the northern part of town is very good. It's easy on/off the freeway and about 1/2 hour to either downtown or Scottsdale. There are plenty of chain restaurants like Red Lobster, Olive Garden, etc. for decent dinners, and shopping for those who are into that. I found the hotel was not up to the level of the two Four Points I've stayed in elsewhere. The room looked tired and the bathroom was smaller than their other locations.By the way, I'm a Starwood Gold member, so I assume my room was one of the better ones. Our price included full buffet breakfast, and I have to say it was one of the worst I've had anywhere. The first day they ran out of coffee before we arrived in the restaurant and it only was replenished after I had eaten. The cereal (raisin bran) was definitely generic, and also stale. There was only whole milk (so much for healthy eating), and the bread and pastries were pretty awful as well. Fruit was your typical cut cantaloupe and honeydew, both of which were tasteless. There were supposed to be vending machines on each floor, but the one on my floor was missing, and my search only turned up a soda machine on the floor below.I was scheduled to stay at another Four Points in another city this week, and when I got home I canceled and booked a different chain. Two days at this one was quite enough for one month.

Even so-called luxury hotels don't measure up to first class hotels in other cities. The Jolly Carlton was a very pleasant surprise. Check in and overall service was great. We were even offered a free room upgrade. The room was spacious, and the bathroom was clean and modern with nice amenities.. The hotel is steps from the Rembrandtplein, around the corner from the flower market and a short walk to the Leisdeplein. Considering the location, it was fairly quiet as well..We'd definitely return.
