I think they did a fantastic job considering Sydney and this hotel was packed with England cricket fans. Staff were friendly and helpful. The cheaper restaurant downstairs was great for children, if a little lively. The room was perfect for what we wanted; two queen beds and coffee-making area. It was clean, modern and in a great location. What more could you want?

Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. One of the reception staff went as far as to write down some useful phrases for us as we had no phrase book. The hotel is ideally situated for exploring the city. The room had a very stylish, contemporary design, with a fabulous bathroom. Be warned room 704 is VERY VERY small (smallest on that floor). It was fine for a couple of nights, but even then we were unable to fit all of our clothes in the small wardrobe (already containing spare pillows and blankets) and two tiny drawers.We did not eat breakfast in the hotel as there was a wonderful cafe, serving speciality breads, virtually opposite the hotel. We found a fantastic Catalan restaurant called L'Olive, five minutes' walk from hotel and off the tourist route (ask at reception for directions). It's not cheap, but great if you want to experience Catalan food - it's best to reserve a table as the place was full. Would definitely go back to H10 Universitat hotel Barcelona, but perhaps not in room 704!

I was travelling to Sydney with my husband and two children, aged 12 and 13, and chose the Harbour plaza because of Trip Advisor reviews. They are not wrong. After a long flight it is fantastic to have such luxury. It is also in a fantastic location - with shops and lots of restaurants. Do not be put off eating at the restaurants just because they have no English outside. Inside most seem to have English translations, or at least one person who can help out. We particularly liked the Moon Chiu (spelling?) on the corner very close to the hotel. We were treated like royalty and the food was very good - and exceptionally good value. The food court offers lots of choice, though we found it better to eat there at lunch time as in the evening it was packed! Our last afternoon/evening was amazing. We went up to the Peak visited Madam Tussaud's - very different to London's. There are lots of models to interest westerners and you can actually get up close and have your picture taken with them. It was very interactive and not too busy. Kids loved it. We then did a lovely short walk around the Peak and went for an evening meal. We booked Cafe Deco restaurant before we left England. It was fab. We had a table inside overlooking the Harbour (see Frommer's website for advice on booking).We all adored Hong Kong and hope to go back again.
