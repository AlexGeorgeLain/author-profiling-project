We spent a long time researching Florence hotels for our 2-week 50th anniversary stay in Florence. What a find! This is a wonderful hotel because of: large, welcoming lobby and bar area with all leather couches and chairs and live gardenia plants; outstandingly helpful front desk staff who served like concierges; two elevators; fantastic location directly on the Arno River and close to nearly all attractions; outstanding, large breakfast room with great variety ofhot and cold foods and superb croissants, white table cloths changed after each table use, uniformed servers for variety of breakfast beverages including cappucino, fresh flowers on each table; a terrific deluxe large room with two huge windows that opened onto the Arno with the Ponte Vechhio close in sight, with a large all marble bathroom,wonderful housekeeping and flexible lighting; a delightful roof garden; close proximity to many good restaurants and trattorias (preferred family-run eateries); in-room safe; and much more. We'll never stay anywhere else in Florence. Only drawback: flat pillows.
