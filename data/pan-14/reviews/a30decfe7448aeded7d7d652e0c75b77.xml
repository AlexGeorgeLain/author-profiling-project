Like most big city hotels it was crowded and bustling with activity. Convenient location for anything on the harbour - ferry, aquarium, restaurants, shopping, sightseeing, etc. The concierge made a great recommendation for dinner - Coast at Cockle Bay Wharf - short walk from the hotel. Absolutely, the best swordfish I have ever had! Restaurant service was excellent too. Hotel was also convenient for an evening ferry to see the Harbour Bridge and Opera House lit up at night.
