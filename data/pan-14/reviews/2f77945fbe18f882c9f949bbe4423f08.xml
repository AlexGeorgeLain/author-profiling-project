I was not expecting too much of this place and was very surprised by the room, it was large, and quiet with a coffee maker, microwave and fridge. The morning breakfast bar was a great with a good variety of items. Loved the make your own waffles which were very good, the only thing bad on the bar was the cheese (yuk!) didn't think cheese could taste yukky, lol. Great location, for driving to hollywood, but not a good location to walk to anywhere.
