First of all let me say this hotel is very well maintained, beautiful vegetation, very very clean. I don't have one single complaint to issue. The people complaining here are just too picky or simply never happy with anything. Its my 6th trip down south, 1st time in Punta Cana and I can say without hesitation, that I would go back anytime. The Gourmet and Japanese restaurants are very good, the hotel is just huge, the club is actually pretty good. I was there with my girlfriend, and both of us loved this resort. Don't forget to tip them, I was so disappointed at the people who didn't tip especially in the a la carte restaurants where the service was fast and very good.The week went by so fast, the weather was hot and the beach is very nice at the resort. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a stay in Punta Cana
