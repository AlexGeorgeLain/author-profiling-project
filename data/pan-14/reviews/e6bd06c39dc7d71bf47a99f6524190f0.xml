It has been an ambition of mine to visit Hong Kong for many years, so I checked with trip adivsor for an hotel opted for the Metropark, boy am I glad that I did.Everything about this hotel was perfect, I had a room on the 7th floor which overlooked Victoria Park (I was there for the Chinese New Year ,so was able to watch the firework display from my room).I did have some meals in the hotel which were of high quality, the service was excellent with a good choice.I cannot understand why this hotel only rates 3 stars as I could not fault it.As other reviewers have said the transport system is just a very short walk away, also another bonus is the abundance of little cafes restaurants, I used the Chilli Garden a couple of times a very friendly Indian place,only about 15 metres to the right.If I ever get the chance I would stay there again.
