The rooms are reasonably comfortable - not large, but I have seen much smaller in Sydney. Windows do not open, so it can get a little stuffy in the room. The gym is tiny, and the whirlpool (which seats just 4 people) would not operate when we tried it. Breakfast had quite a wide range including a self-serve juice bar, but was missing a few of my favourites e.g. toasted muesli, cream, and plain, gelatine-free yogurt. For tea and coffee, you have to catch the attention of the staff, but they do serve it hot. All the hotel staff were friendly and efficient. Overall it is a reasonable city hotel, but neither especially exciting nor a stand-out bargain.
