They're working on the exterior, lanai's, etc., presently.Rooms are simply furnished. The musty odour, It is the tropics after all, disappears quickly after the a/c is turned on. Again furniture, carpet, fixtures have seen better times. On the other hand the rooms are large and serviceable with a fridge and coffee maker. I was quite satisfied for the price. Staff are very helpful. Checked my bags for me as I had a late flight. In addition there is a hospitality room on the third floor for a shower and change of clothes before leaving for the airport. The 16th floor is the site of the continental breakfast served on the lanai. Could get crowded I'm told, but as I'm an early riser, no problems for me.There is an ABC store on site that can supply you with most anything. There is also a tour desk which is quite handy. Getting around? The Bus stop is outside the main entrance although everything in Wakiki is within walking distance.I'd definetely use this property again. Good value, good location, super staff.By the way, Waikiki can be expensive. Walk a few blocks to escape the beach area and you'll find lots of great inexpensive bars and restaurants.
