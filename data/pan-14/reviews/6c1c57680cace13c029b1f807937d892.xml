(Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku is a close second.) I try to book it every business trip to Sydney.Minimalist modern rooms; motorized blinds, glass bathroom, flat screen TV. This appeals to me but might not be everyone's taste. Some earlier reviews describe this as sterile and I can see that some people might see it that way.Location is good for business and holiday; close to Town Hall train station, walk to downtown area, Darling Harbor or Circular Quay.I can use the executive lounge which serves complimentary cooked and continental breakfasts, snacks and drinks during the day until late.Comprehensive gym in the basement. Zeta bar is a good place to invite colleagues for a night out - long lines on Friday night so it's popular with the locals as well.A friend with an assistance dog shared the room last stay. The Hilton accepted this without any drama; one staff in the exec lounge was at first unaware of the hotel policy on assistance dogs; one cleaning woman seemed to be terrified of the dog, otherwise Pema quickly become a favorite with the other hotel guests. Seems people are i) surprised and delighted to see a dog in the lift ii) perhaps missing their own pets.We asked a lot of the staff during the week and they graciously accommodated every request. Professional and personable.
