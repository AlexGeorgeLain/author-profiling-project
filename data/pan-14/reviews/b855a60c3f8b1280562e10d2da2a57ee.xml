We booked it on the basis of the rating it has consistently received from TravelAdvisor. We were not disappointed - the hotel is pleasant without being overwhelming, the staff are friendly and attentive, the location is great, quiet but convenient. Incidentally, Plaza Santa Anna just 5 minutes walk from the hotel is a great location for tapas and people watching in the evenings.
