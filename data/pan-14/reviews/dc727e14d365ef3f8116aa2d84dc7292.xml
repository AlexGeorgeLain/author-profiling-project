I've subtracted half a point merely because the hotel is expensive, and you will need to get a cab whenever you want to go out to the shops or bars (south beach is around 20 minutes drive). BUT if you're happy to relax in the hotel - or if you're a business traveller - it's perfect. You cannot fail to feel pampered and relaxed. We thought the service was impeccable and I was surprised to read some of the negative comments. Every member of staff (front desk, spa staff and pool staff) were focused on making sure we had a comfortable stay. We loved the complimentary smoothie samples by the side of the pool!! I would also recommend Azul (the hotel restaurant) which serves delicious asian fusion food and fantastic wine.
