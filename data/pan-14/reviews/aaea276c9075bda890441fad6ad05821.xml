As we were only in Seattle for one night for a football game, it seemed logical to stay at Holiday Inn, SeaTac. Next time, I'll just spend the extra cash and stay somewhere else. Another reviewer has already mentioned the inept check-in staff. I would absolutely agree. The room I was given was supposed to be non-smoking. It absolutely REEKED of cigarette smoke. I was given another room 2 doors up which had no such smell but did not offer the same Priority Club benefits as the previous room (not sure why this was, as it was never explained). Another reviewer also mentioned the paper thin walls. Agreed! Our new room was opposite the ice machine. Oh my Lord I could hear every single cube of ice ALL night, and I am a pretty heavy sleeper. The bed and pillow were comfortable, shame I couldn't get to sleep on them!Bathroom was very small, and the room perfectly functional. The airport transfer was fast and efficient. I didn't stay for breakfast so I have no idea of the restaurant quality. Overall, this hotel was OK, but I am certain that other hotels in the area would offer better value, comfort and service.
