When I was shown to the room on arrival it had a view of the balconies of the adjoining building and a small amount of garden. When I explained that this is not what I had paid for the room was changed - again ithis room did not have a direct ocean view but was more pleasant.The hotel is not for the elderly or the feint hearted. The restaurants, pool and bars are reached by means of stairs which are not well illuminated at night and there are no hand rails. Everything is spread out and it can take up to ten minutes walking to get to a location and retutn to the room.Another problem is the remote locaton of the complex. This tends to make the visitor a captive to the dining and beverage facilties at the hotel which are very expensive by Bali standards.Boquets must be awared to good service and smiling staff.
