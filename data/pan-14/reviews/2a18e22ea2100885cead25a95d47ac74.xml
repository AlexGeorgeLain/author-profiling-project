The transfer was seamless and even taking us to our room bypassing reception was gratefully received. The hotel was spotless the service perfection.The room was excellant and breakfast interesting. The view over towards the Lion and the esplanade from the balcony was great. Access to the MRT was airconditioned and a welcome relief from the humidity of Singapore. For a central hotel this hotel will take some beating.
