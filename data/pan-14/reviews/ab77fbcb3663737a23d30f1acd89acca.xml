Also at the top of Van Ness Avenue which is one of the main roads through San Francisco so it was fairly easy to find and easy to get away from.Our room was on 17th floor overlooking Chinatown. Good room size. Clean. Fridge in room and also iron and ironing board. Limited hanging space for clothes but we managed.Lots of restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel if you don't want to eat your evening meal in the hotel. We found an excellent Thai one just around the corner which was also very cheap. You can park in the hotel car park which is secure but not cheap but the lift goes to the car park so there is no problem with luggage.Breakfast is buffet and was fine.We loved San Francisco. If I returned I would stay at this hotel again.

We had a Ku'damm view room which was excellent except for the bed which we found quite uncomfortable. We ate in the hotel's 44 restaurant the first night and this was excellent if pricey - well it has a Michelin Star. The hotel staff could not do enough for you. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel location is good being just round the corner from the hop on hop off bus tours and within easy reach of most of the main Berlin sights. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay right in the heart of this vibrant city.
