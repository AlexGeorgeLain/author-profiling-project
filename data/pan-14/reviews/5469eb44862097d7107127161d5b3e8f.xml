Requested service for removal twice...nothing done. My kids were bitten all over. I try to be brief but informative.Overall: Would not go back to Melia or PC.Grounds: Outstanding....gorgeous. A very large property. If you have very young ones....you will have a problem. The walk from my room to the beach was about 10 minutes. No problem for me..but my 4 year old preferred the shuttle. So.. you have to wait for the shuttle...then its about a 2 minute ride....going. Coming back from the beach is another matter. A 10 minute walk through a nice property turns into a 30 minute ride through the whole property....a real pain.Beach: Outstanding...nothing more to say about it.Pools: Nice, but not maintained enough for my liking. During my week there, the filters were not working for two days...and they still did not ensure that scimming was done regularly....very puzzling to me.Food: Average...as all the all inclusives are. If you are looking for gourmet meals...you shouldn't be traveling to these kinds of resorts.Entertainment: Terrible. If you have kids, you would like to have something start before 9:00pm. I believe the motive here is to get you bored out of your mind so that you will visit the casino!Bottom Line: If you don't require gambling or golf, why would you go to the D.R.? There are many places to go where the weather and the beaches are just as good...the food as good or better and the entertainment far superior...for the whole family. Choose carefully before you book the D.R.!
