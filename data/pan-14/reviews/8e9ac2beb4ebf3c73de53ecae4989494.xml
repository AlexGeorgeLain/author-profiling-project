Its probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Every element of our stay was perfect, we stayed in the garden wing and our room was excellent. Breakfast at the line restaurant is something truly special. Hotel is in a good location a 10 minute walk from orchard road and the staff are all so friendly and helpful. We wouldnt be back as soon as we can.
