The check-in staff were helpful and friendly although I was thre only one checking in so pressure wasnt great!The rooms were large and functional and were pretty standard as far as US hotel rooms are concerned.The staff were really helpful and friendly throughout the stay and the conference staff were very efficient although when I asked for some photocopying to be done, I was referred to the business centre. The business center was a surprise as you you had to pay for the services with a credit card when I would have preferred( and got!) this cost added to the central bill.The hotel is a little noisy with a club about 200meters from the hotel throwing folks out at around 2am which is a pity.Local services are great though with many bars and restaurants to choose from.
