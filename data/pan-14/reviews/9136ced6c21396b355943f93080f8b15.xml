It wouldn't be to everyone's taste as it's quite industrial in design. We had a very large bedroom. Good breakfasts. The staff were very helpful and went to a lot of trouble to book a restaurant for us when we were having problems finding a place. Although I really liked the hotel and the area it was in I would probably look for something a little more central the next time. Yes, you can get the bus or train easily but that does take up precious time if you are in the city for a weekend.

The room was lovely - airy and nicely furnished. They've done a great job restoring the building and the rooftop bar is lovely. The location of the hotel is fantastic and although the street outside is busy it's part of the charm of Madrid and closing the windows did keep out a lot of the noise. The reception area is not very impressive - a small sort of antechamber - but I suspect that is so that the building is preserved properly. My only gripe was that the bed is on wheels and tends to move away from the wall. However I'm sure there must be brakes - I just forgot to ask.
