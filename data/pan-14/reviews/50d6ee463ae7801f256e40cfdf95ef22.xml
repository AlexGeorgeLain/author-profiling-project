I enjoyed my stay for several reasons: 1) the hotel staff were exceptionally courteous and helpful, 2) the room was exceptionally clean and well cared for; I couldn't find anything to complain about, 3) the restauraunt served an excellent breakfast which was either buffet style or off the menu style, 4) the restaurant converted to a French style restaurant in the evening and was excellent in quality although somewhat pricey. My only minor complaint was the location of the hotel made it a bit difficult to find at night and I did not feel comfortable going out by foot at night. Old San Juan and other points of interest required a taxi to reach. Ratewise I felt the hotel was fairly priced; I paid about $140/night after having booked the reservation through the Marriott website and choosing the Senior Rate (62 years or older). I am returning to San Juan in January and will be staying at the Courtyard Marriott Miramar once again.
