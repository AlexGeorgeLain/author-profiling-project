The staff are helpful and will investigate any question you have (we were inquiring about nightclubs and restraunts a lot). The 24 hour food is an original and convenient idea. Loved the showers and the lounge too. The hotel is right beside Las Ramblas so within walking distance of everything. Highly recommended.PS- WATCH YOUR WALLET. Pickpockets are everywhere in Barcelona. Keep your wallet in an inside pocket if possible. Be careful in the back streets around Las Ramblas and on the escalators in the Metro. The bastards tried to steal my wallet twice in three days!
