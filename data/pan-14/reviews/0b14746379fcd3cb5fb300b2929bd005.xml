Lane Victory at 7:30 a.m. the following morning.Strangely, although the room was very clean, the furniture in good shape, and the bed comfortable, the carpet of Room 215 was FILTHY. It made the soles of my feet black within five minutes of my stepping out of the shower. (If you take the trouble to scrupulously clean the rest of the room, why not shampoo the carpet once in a while?)Also, though the hotel appeared to be barely occupied, the desk clerk claimed it was full, and wouldn't give me a quieter room on the back side of the hotel. In the rooms facing Gaffey Street, the traffic sounds are LOUD (cars with thumping speakers at all hours; big rigs downshifting for the stoplight half a block away; police sirens). I had to leave the air on all night to try to muffle the noise. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the neighborhood looks a bit iffy, and I wouldn't walk around there after dark. The 21 Sushi restaurant next door was good and reasonably priced; it was frequented by regular local customers, many of whom the owner greeted by name.If the carpet were cleaner, this would be a good hotel for the price.
