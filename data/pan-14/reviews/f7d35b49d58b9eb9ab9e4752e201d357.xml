I read many reviews and comments on the forums and was expecting average. What we experienced was exceptional. The staff was fabulous. Always smiling and willing to help in any way. The bartenders were extremely fun and engaging (Thanks Braulio and Reuben!) The poolside animation team was fun and energetic. The facilities were very well maintained. Our room was three buildings off the beach and pool area. The room was a bit dated but we only used it to sleep and freshen up a bit. The food was good. Not great, but I wasn't expecting fine dining. We went to the steakhouse one night and were very pleased with the quality and service. The beach was nothing less than amazing. We always found chairs to relax in for our daily afternoon catnap. Never a problem with lack of beach chairs. We will be back!
