I went to Barcelona for a conference, IAVE 2004, and got cheated on by the person that rented me an apt with wireless Internet connection that had NONE. So I walked to the forum and was desperate to find an accommodation. I saw the AC and asked for a quote. The one they gave me was excellent so I stayed there for the whole conference. I didn't realise it at that time because it was my first conference but the AC Barcelona was the best hotel I've been into. Free minibar, free jacuzzi (last floor), hifi in the room, FREE wireless Internet, gorgeous bathroom (green and black), excellent mattress and pillows. The only negative (VERY negative) note was the maid. The first day we had forgotten to hang the do not disturb card out, so she made it in. Our fault. The second day she used her keys *despite* the card. We protested with the manager. The third day we resolved to put a chair against the door to avoid her getting in while we were sleeping naked. And yet she tried. Only the day before the last she finally understood to stop such behavior.
