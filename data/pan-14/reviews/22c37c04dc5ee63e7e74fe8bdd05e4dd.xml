The area was safe and hotel quite clean and fancy. The wall paintings, fixtures and everything was very retro and at the same time took you back in florence history. The room/bathroom was not only clean but very charming and colorful. We just loved this place. breakfast was included, desk staff was very helpful, i think couple of owners are always there. This was a 2 star hotel in price and 4 star otherwise. A great find !!

Overall the location was good, it was behind the hyatt regency and few blocks from kalakua ave. breakfast in the morning was muffins, juice and banana but they were very fresh and did not have US mainland taste. rooms were tiny but modern, enough for two people who are visiting hawaii.
