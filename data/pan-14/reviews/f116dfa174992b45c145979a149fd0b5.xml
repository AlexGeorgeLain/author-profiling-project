The meticulously-clean and spacious rooms, clever layout and amenities, splendid views and superb business location made it a perfect choice. The only negative was the absence of a hotel directory identifying the hotel amenities - the fitness center and other facilities. When I asked the concierge about a directory, he advised that it was on one of the television channels. During my stay the television channel was off the air although there was a general Boston tourist channel and a hotel events channel, but no directory on any channel. As a result I was unable to identify or use many of the amenities at the hotel.
