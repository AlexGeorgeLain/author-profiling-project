Le Meridian was somewhat difficult to find off the Bart stop even with the directions. I called ahead and the staff was nice enough to give us an early check-in and gave us a room on the higher floors which have a much better view. We could see the bay out our window. I have this preconceived notion that when you buy something off a discount website that you are going to discount service but that wasn't the case here. Everyone was nice and the Bell Hops were pretty hilarious. The hotel is located downtown so if your there on a Sunday, nothing is really open. All the restaurants and bars close early but a short walk to Little Italy or Chinatown and they stay open pretty late down there. There is an Irish Bar across the street that is about the only thing open after 9pm. We didn't attempt the hotel restaurant though. Good location and pretty accessible to mass transit for the touristy stuff. Rooms were gorgeous and the bathroom was also pretty ornate. They even gave out robs to enjoy during your stay which was a nice addition. Definitely would recommend.
