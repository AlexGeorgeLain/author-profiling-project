We booked a Cool Corner Suite and was not let down. It was a little smaller than I anticipated, but it worked out for everyone. The door staff was awesome and really helpful. Upon unloading our vehicle they had noticed that we had bought some adult beverages and told us that we had to conceal it, or they wouldn't let us in with it. They were cool in that they helped us conceal it and make sure that we got it up to the room. They also helped us make reservations for typical bachelor party establishments and allowed us access to the hotel SUV rather than calling for a cab.Later on we came back and went to the Ghostbar. We were told 2 people per room could get in without paying (I assumed free). When I got the bill the next morning I saw there was a $30 Ghostbar charge, and come to find out we were charged $15 per person, instead of the normal $20 cover charge. I was pretty disappointed by this as I was led to believe by the check-in staff that it was free.The Ghostbar is awesome with tons of beautiful people. The service is good and the people never really seemed snotty or stuck-up. We will definitely go back to the Ghostbar the next time we are in town, likely to be OU/TX weekend.
