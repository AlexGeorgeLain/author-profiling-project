My husband arrived first for his conference; I met him a few days later. He said the room was VERY small, but clean and comfortable. It didn't have a window, but that's not a big deal. However, he asked to change rooms after his 2nd night because there was some air conditioning thing outside his room that clicked on before 6 every morning and made noise. The folks at the Pelham were very nice and had no problems doing that. When I arrived, it was to the new room. It was still small, but lovely. Everything was very clean and remained so throughout our stay. The only thing someone might be upset about is the fact that they were doing construction on the building across the street from our room (we had a window this time) and they started around 6:30am! However, we were already up but someone recovering from the previous night may not appreciate it. But that's not the fault of the hotel - just make sure you ask for a room not overlooking that side. And in regards to the neighborhood, I was a female alone while my husband was in meetings, and I felt perfectly fine going back and forth. There is a homeless shelter across the street on one side of the building (not the entrance) but it's not unsafe - I walked by alone several times and no one even looked at me, much less harassed me. And it is literally a block from the Quarter - totally within walking distance. For us, the stay at the Pelham turned out fine.
