Rooms are large but very plain, with furnishings and fixtures as cheap as possible. The hotel shows its age and badly needs refurbishing. Bathroom sink was on a slight slant because it was pulling out of the wall. Nothing is especially terrible or unacceptable about this hotel. It is just subpar.

The room was all white with dark brown furnishings. The bathroom basin was of frosted glass. The bathroom arrangement was fronted with glass and had no door. You could look directly from the bedroom area through the glass into the shower stall and bathroom counter area. The room had a low profile bed, closet, safe and roomy bathroom granite counter.The hotel is an easy 2-block walk directly north of the main train station. Most of its ground-floor public area is taken up with the hotel's restaurant. The lobby consists of just a long registration desk located in a small room.
