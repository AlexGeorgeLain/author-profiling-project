The Hilton Garden Inn met all these requirements for us.The only issue I had, and why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of it's location. It's not in walking distance to main siights of Florence and because of the weather (35 degrees C) it was too hot to get the very crowded bus so we had to get a taxi into town every day which varied in cost but was approx 12euros each way.The rooms were very nice. New, nicely decorated, spotlessly clean and the shower was great. It was a really nice place to come back to after a days sight seeing in the summer heat.A perfect business hotel and a good place to stay for tourists who prefer a more modern alternative to most of the city centre hotels.
