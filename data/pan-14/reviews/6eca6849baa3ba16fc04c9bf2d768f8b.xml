I read many reviews of hotels in the area and decided on Comfort Inn based on those reviews. I was not disappointed. The taxi ride from the airport was a little hairy, but we survived. Polite staff at the counter greeted us. Our room was clean and the price was right. Nothing special, but nice enough. We paid $127 for one night. A short walk to a small plaza and beach area. Safe and very clean area to walk around. Police are seen all over. Restaurants within walking distance. We took the bus (B21) to Old San Juan, the bus stop is just a few blocks away.Our cruise did not leave until later the next day and check out in noon, but Brenda locked our luggage (and several other travelor's luggage) up in a small room off the front desk so we could tour around Old San Juan without it.
