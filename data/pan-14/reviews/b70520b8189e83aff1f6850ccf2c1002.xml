Without exception, the staff was professional, courteous and efficient, yet personable, amicable and warm. A smile and a pleasant salutation greeted us whenever we walked the common areas of the hotel. They seemed to take a genuine interest in our well-being.The rooms were exquisite, beyond anything I had ever experienced - from frescoed walls to canopied beds. If our future travel plans include Europe, Florence will be one of our destinations and The Grand Hotel will, once again, be our respite from the rigors of vacation travel.
