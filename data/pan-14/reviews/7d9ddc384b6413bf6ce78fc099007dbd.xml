Hotel staff were great, room was large and comfortable, with a large bar area for arranging refreshments. (Also a convenient grocery store about two blocks away for stocking your fridge.) Breakfast in adjacent restaurant was fine, we were directed to an excellent restaurant a few blocks away for dinner, and there are casual college-neighborhood eating places nearby on Broadway. What was unbeatable, however, was the combination of free breakfast, free internet, free parking in the garage, and a free shuttle service to take you to and from the most popular tourist points in town.
