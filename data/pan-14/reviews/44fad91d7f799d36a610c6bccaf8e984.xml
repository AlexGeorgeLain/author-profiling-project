The Lleo was ideal in locality; near to the main shopping square - Plaza de Catalyuna and near the top of Las Ramblas. It is roughly a 30 minute walk to the harbour (strolling down Las Ramblas and its many attractions - hold on to your wallets/purses). The hotel is clean, friendly and spacious; the bedrooms are variable in respect of furnishings. Two colleagues requested changes and were quickly accommodated. Some of us had electric beds! most doubles are twins pushed together but overall colleagues were delighted. Though on the fourth flooor at the front we were not aware of street noise but I would advise not to have a room adjacent to the lifts. Breakfasts were delightful - hot and cold buffet with plenty of coffee. You could sit there until midday! - but who would do that with the various delights of such a remarkable city to explore. The Tourist bus(2 possible routes) is a must and starts but a short walk from the Lleo. Airport taxi cost 21Euros for 4 with cases (though one friend paid 29 on the return).
