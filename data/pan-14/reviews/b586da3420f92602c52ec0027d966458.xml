Possibly my worst experience of Los Angeles.We had been touring the west coast for 3 weeks and booked this hotel as our final destination, the last 3 nights of our holiday. It was the most expensive and by far the worst in both terms of facilities and service.When we arrived there was some kind of magician's event on at the club....we found it very difficult to find parking...but accepted that it was a one off due to the event.When we arrived at reception our visit started promisingly, we were met with a cocktail and a very enthusiastic female. We were shown to our room....right at the very back of the hotel in a corner on the first floor.Right away...I had my reservations. The room layout was very very odd and snug to say the least. As we had been travelling by parter was desperate for a shower. As soon as the shower went on..the lights and the tv in the room started to flash on and off.....there was a terrible rackett from a generator and the pwoer cut on and off....Right away I called reception who told me they'd send an engineer....The engineer arrived to tell me that the room had been made by splitting a larger room into two...and that he'd had reservations about the electricity circuit since it had been done. Right away I called reception to explain....they advised that they'd fix it the following day. I refused to stay in a room which was unsafe. To be fair to the hotel...all be it grudgingly....they moved us another room, a much larger room, right next to reception.
