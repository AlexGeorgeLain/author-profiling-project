I had requested an upper floor room, away from the fans which have been referred to in other reviews. We were on the opposite side of the building and had a great view of the Ft. DeRussy park and the beautiful little city park across the street. There was some traffic noise, which is to be expected in Waikiki, however we were able to sit on our lanai and enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery. We saw absolutely no bugs and everything was clean and well maintained. We had cleaning service every day. I especially liked the fact that the floors were tile and not carpet, which was easier to maintain without the feel of walking on dirty carpet. This hotel is right on the edge of Waikiki, therefore out of the hustle and bustle of tourist traffic, yet close enough to walk to anything you desire. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who plans a stay in the Waikiki area.
