We had a double with shower, but should have reserved a room with a bath (to ease tired muscles after hours of walking each day). Very clean with all of the necessities.A quiet neighbourhood with a variety of cafes, restaurants, bakeries, etc. - good access to the Metro. Staff were very friendly and particularly helpful when my wife took ill one night - searched out a pharmacy that was open, called a cab and even asked how she was feeling the next day.Wouldn't hesitate to return.SB Graham, Toronto
