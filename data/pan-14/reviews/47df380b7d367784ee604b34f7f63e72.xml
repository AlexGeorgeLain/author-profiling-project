The staff was great, especially the bar staff.Easy walking to most areas of the french quarter. A very helpful bellman/concierge who even walked us to the Napolean House on his lunchbreak. Many tours available through the hotel. We did a swampboat tour and a tour of some of the antibellum mansions/plantations outside the city. Im writing this review late,and seeing what Katrina did to a wonderfull city just broke our hearts. I hope people will go to see it now and help via thier business in rebuilding.
