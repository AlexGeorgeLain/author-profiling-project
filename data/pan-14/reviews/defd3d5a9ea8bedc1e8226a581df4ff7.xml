My room was a suite which included a large bedroom with private patio, an entry way over water with chairs and table at the end and on the other side a huge bathroom. The bedroom had cable tv with free DVDs loaned from the main desk. Good air conditioning plus ceiling fan and at night mosquito net around the bed with special candle if needed. The bathroom had a lovely huge bath, excellent separate shower and was open at the top also. The entryway had a frog also. The hotel has a nice small restaurant and we enjoyed our breakfast very much. My son chose the pancakes. There is a very pretty pool with ample seating and nearby an outside bar with more seating and lots of paperback books or games to play. There was a free computer room with several newspapers also. All the employees were very pleasant and the hotel has a free transportation into Ubud every hour. One evening we arranged for the driver to pick us up after a dance performance in town. There is also a well equipped gym room, a spa and other amenities which I didn't use. The location is very lovely as the hotel seems completely isolated with nothing around to spoil the mood. Every morning there is a free hike to the rice fields. There are some nice restaurants within walking distance and also a few museums and craft stores.
