On our arrival we were welcomed back by the staff and then once we had got ourselves settled we were given a complimentry bottle of wine. Due to my wife just coming out of hospital and not being able to walk far, the staff made sure that a cab was always on hand for us especially on the evenings we were going to the theatre. Nothing is too much trouble day or night. The rooms and corridors are always clean and the food is great. If you need a base for a few days or a week this is the place. Its close to the river,parliment and all the main tourist sites.
