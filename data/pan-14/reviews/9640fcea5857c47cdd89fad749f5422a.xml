The hotel allocated me a standard twin room facing the rear of the property with a view of some offices and a brick wall at the back of the hotel, when I complained about the room I was informed that no deluxe rooms would become available during my stay. I was not offered any compensation for the lower standard of room but as I got a bargain (free upgrade to deluxe room and 20% discount) when booking the hotel, I was less inclined to let this spoil my trip. I feel the hotel gave me the room I paid for, a standard room with no view. The room was very clean and while not tiny it is small. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was hot and powerful. The location of this hotel was ideal within reasonable walking distance of most of attractions. Rembrandtsplein is a 5 min walk and Dam Square is 15 min walk. The hotel is beside the Flower Market and is serviced by the No. 4 9 16 24 25 26 trams at Muntplein.The hotel is very clean and the staff very helpful not withstanding the error in room allocation. I would stay here again as the location is excellent for visiting Amsterdam, but I would have lower expectations on room size and quality.
