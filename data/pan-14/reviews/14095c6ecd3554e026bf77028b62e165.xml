Relaxing, nice and friendly staff (for italian people: large part of them can speak in italian). Quite difficult to find because it's not on the main street. 10 minutes faraway by foot from Lesseps underground station.In 15 minutes you can reach town center. Rooms of various size (have been there for 3 times), clean and with good facilities. Some rooms are quite distant from wireless Internet connection so there's not a top class connection. Continental breakfast is Ok but not so wonderful for italian people(I'm italian but I'm used to stay abroad in hotel for working so no problems for me). Only 10minutes walking faraway from Park Guell, one of the most beautiful places in Barcellona in my opinion.
