If you're staying at other places during your trip, I would recommend staying here last as nothing else could possibly compare favorably! :-) It's way up on the northern coast of Bali, not really near anything, city wise. The villas were gorgeous, the pool magnificent, and the food 5 star. There are only 6 villas on the property so you eventually get to know the other people staying there. We did the dinner and dolphin package and the dophin tour was amazing! We saw a ton of them. It's expensive though, rooms, tours, and food, so be aware of that. Of all the places we stayed, Damai is the one we still talk about all the time. sigh

Affordable, less crowded, etc. Tegal Sari is lovely with nice (not luxurious) rooms and great views. Our room overlooked a rice patty. It is a 15 minute walk from town and 10 minutes to the monkey forest. So, out of the way, but not TOO out of the way. The staff were really accommodating and gave great customer service. We were celebrating our honeymoon, and the staff left us a huge basket of flowers with a lovely note with well wishes for a great honeymoon. We still get emails from them wishing us happy birthdays every year! We booked this hotel on recommendation of some friends who had been there a few months before and we were not disappointed.
