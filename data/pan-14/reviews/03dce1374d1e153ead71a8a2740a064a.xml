The skywalk is a great alternative to the hotel shuttle however the shuttle does run every 10-15 minutes. Check in was easy and pleasant. We ordered room service which was VERY good, it arrived on time and hot. We had a very early flight out the next morning and the ZIP CHECKOUT made our departure all the easier. One call to an automated line and we were on our way. I was a tad concerned when we returned as our flight was delayed and we didnt get in until 1:00 a.m. I had not requested a late check and was concerned that perhaps they didn't hold our room. No need to worry, they did. Even at 1:00 a.m. they had plenty of front desk staff to attend to us as well as other travelers. Room service was even available at that hour and again the food arrived on time and hot. The Hilton is a nice resting spot in between flights and we will stay there again in the future.
