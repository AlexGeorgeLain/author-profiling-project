Decent hotel with a good location close to The Forbidden City and some of the parks. Close to the shopping street Wufujing also. The boys who worked at the hotel was very friendly. The room was small, the carpet was dirty. Except for that the room was okey and very quiet during the night.PROS:*Good location* Friendly staff* Quiet during the nightCONS:* Small rooms* Dirty carpet* No free internet
