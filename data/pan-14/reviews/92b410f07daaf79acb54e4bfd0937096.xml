Tourists used to American hotels might complain about the size of the bathroom or narrow windows are not used to UK accomodations. This is a modern, classy, trendy, but generous property. First class restaurant, great bar, good sized rooms, decent health club, and perfect location for tourists. (And a decent location for business travelers, especially if you have meetings spread out around the City, West End, and Chelsea/Knightsbridge.) Strongly recommend it - a much better alternative than the traditional British property with tiny slow elevators and bad food.

		<document id="d23ded16d686e120ebc896bc326fa00f" url=""><![CDATA[Very mixed review Stayed here for one night in July 2008. Very mixed view. The rooms are great, and if you have one with a river view, even better. But the common areas are dated, worn, and in need of upgrading. On-site lounge, allegedly voted Boston's best jazz club, was shut down before 11;30 at night. Also, the neighborhood is horrible. You are right off the highway, but there is no area to walk around in. Bordered on the expressway on one side, railroad tracks on another, an intersection, and an industrial park. So, you can't walk around outside the perimeter fence. The property definitely serves a purpose, but you could probably do better. Good value, sure, but I'm not itching to return.
