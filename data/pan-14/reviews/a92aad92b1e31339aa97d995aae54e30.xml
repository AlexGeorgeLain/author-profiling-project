Because of this, its pricey.However, because its small (they say its the smallest Hyatt in the world) it gives a very personal touch to service which is nice - makesone feel at home which is not a common feeling in Paris!Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped although the Air Conditioning in mine didn't work!!There is a bit of a shortage of dining outlets but what there is is good. Its probably best to eat out.Well worth a visit if you are looking for a smaller, friendly hotel.
