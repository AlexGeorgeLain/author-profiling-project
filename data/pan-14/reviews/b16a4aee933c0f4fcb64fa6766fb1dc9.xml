Upon arrival we were given a very warm welcome by the staff, check in was quick and easy and all our requests had been attended to, our rooms were ready, clean and met all our expectations. I would recommend this hotel without reservation as everything was 1st class, the location was perfect for sight seeing, Las Ramblas etc. Highly recommended and will definately stay again, all of our group felt the same.
