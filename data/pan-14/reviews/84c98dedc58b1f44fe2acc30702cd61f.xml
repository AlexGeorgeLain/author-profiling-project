There was plenty of room to move, and the shower and bed was great!we got free dvds to hire, free internet, and then the day we checked out, we stored our luggage for free there until 6pm!!this hotel was gorgeous and modern.I will only stay here now in london, i wish i found this hotel when we first stayed in london instead of trialing alot of dumps first!!location excellent as well. walking distance from victoria and westminister. Perfect!!
