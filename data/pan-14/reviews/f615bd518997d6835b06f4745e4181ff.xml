It is in a very safe and clean area but the area was somewhat dead for restaurants and bars. There were limited quality restaurants within a short walk. Dinner around Sagrada Familia is poor. I recommend the short walk on Gran Via (towards La Rambla) or the longer walk to La Ribera. It is near a train station. The breakfast was typical European and good. The rooms were new and very clean. There is a mini bar and TV. There is an elevator and rooms have AC. Nice bathrooms. Free wireless internet in room. The staff was very nice but seem very knowledgeable about getting around town. Maybe they deal with more business travelers.

The free internet terminal and wi-fi are a plus. If you are looking for an American-type hotel, then stay at a chain. If you want a nice European hotel with charm, then stay at the Casci.
