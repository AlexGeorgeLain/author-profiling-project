The room was amazing with a large sitting area, nice decor, plenty of space and an incredibly comfortable bed. The staff was excellent, from the valets to the front desk to the pool side wait staff. The spa is very nice and the massages were amazing - we had a married couple do our couples massage and they were perfect! Dragonfly has excellent food and a good atmosphere - and their room service is just as good, it took only 20 minutes to get our food and it was hot and fresh. The pool scene (both night and day) is trendy and a bit crowded - definitely the look at me crowd - but everyone was nice and the service was excellent. I'd also recommend walking across the street to the Crescent building and having dinner at Nobu. Amazing seafood and sushi with a contemporary atmosphere and excellent service. We will be staying there the next time we're in Dallas!
