First, the physical stucture: very unassuming hotel from the outside but nicely designed interior and meticulously clean. Feels like an inn more than a hotel. Rooms were large with gorgeous marble appointed bathrooms. One word, luxury.Second, Location: We found the location perfect. 10-15 minute walk to the Duomo and everything else for that matter. Near the bus line. Off the main bustle of the tourist hotels. Loved it.Finally, the staff: Very friendly, all speak english well. The breakfeast spread was excellent.In addition, don't miss the Stibbert museum. It is within walking distance from the San Gallo, opposite direction from the Duomo. Coolest place we visited, midievil artifacts of every kind.
