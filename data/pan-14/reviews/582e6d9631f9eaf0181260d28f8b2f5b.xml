We arrived early and were immediately allocated a room by a friendly staff member on reception. We mentioned that my husband was doing the marathon and were told that all marathon runners were being given free porridge on the day of the marathon, and that the restaurant was opening early to serve them. This was extremely welcome and much appreciated.We were pleased by everything at the Hoxton. The rooms were well equipped, clean and comfortable. All members of staff were pleasant and helpful. The food and drink was good value, no high priced hotel rip offs here! We would recommend the Hoxton highly and would definitely stay again.
