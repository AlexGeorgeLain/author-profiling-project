The rooms were very clean, modern and suited our needs. Just a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas, which we found very expensive to have a snack and a few drinks, better sticking to the restaurant at the top of the street near the hotel. The hotel was very handy for the tour bus, and we also went on the Catamaran tour of Barcelona. Lovely city and would return and stay at this hotel.
