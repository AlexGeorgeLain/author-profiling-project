It's little more than the longest souvenir strip mall in the world. Luckily, if you stay at Hotel Jazz, it's close enough to the Ramblas to be close, and far enough that you won't be bothered by all the vending. Overall, Hotel Jazz is well and centrally located.The interiors are modern, hard-edged, and hip. The only drawback is that the design of the hallways is also modern, hard-edged, and hip, and not furnished with wall-to-wall sound-attenuating carpet. That translates to NOISY. What with the staff slamming doors, insensitive guests slamming doors, and every child slamming doors, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM it's reminiscent of being in the middle of the orchestra pit during Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, complete with brass cannons.Outstanding breakfast. Nice roof deck with inconsequential pool.Fairly helpful staff who were unable to accommodate me with a mere two hour late checkout after a five-night stay.I would probably stay there again, but not before checking out the alternatives more closely.

Quite far from the Prado, Reina Sofia and Retiro Park. I had a VERY small room with no view of anything (except other hotel windows). Outstanding breakfast. I would stay here again, but would assiduously research other options before doing so.
