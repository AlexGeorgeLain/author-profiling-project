Probably better on the higher floors, we were on the first fllor.The staff were very helpful apart from the mess up with the taxis. We wanted one 6 seater and we got 2 four seaters so we had to pay twice for the journey back to the airport. We should have used the bus as we did when we arrived.Ask for a room at the front. The views are nicer and all the windows are double glazed so no road noise. The rooms are also airconditioned.
