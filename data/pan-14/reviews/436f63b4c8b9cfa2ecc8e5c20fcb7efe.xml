The room comes with a small fridge and a microwave and there are little markets nearby. The bus stop is about 2 blocks away and can take you to most of the tourist sights. Fisherman's Wharf is about a 20 minute walk away. The rooms here are on the small side but if you're not spending much time there, does it really matter? There is a small Italian restaurant nearby called the Cafe Lombard and the food is very good. Also, my daughter and I felt safe in this area. I would stay here again. I booked directly with the hotel and paid $114 per night USD in July 2005. Parking is free, a BIG plus.
