The hotel is modern with all ammenities including a roof top pool and gymnasium, a wonderful and reasonably priced restaurant, great front desk personnel and convenient to Las Ramblas. We stayed there for 3 nights from August 19-21, 2005. The room was a nice size, the bathroom was very modern and the decor up to date. Breakfast can be included for an additional charge. We felt that the cost was very reasonable given the ammenities and convenience. We highly recommend the hotel to visitors to Barcelona, a great city to visit.
