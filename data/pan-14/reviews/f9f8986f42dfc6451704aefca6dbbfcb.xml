If you are looking for a moderately price hotel in a quiet neighborhood and you don't mind a 10 to 15 minute bus ride from the Duomo, Hotel Ungherese is the place. (We met other travelers that spent much more and complained of hearing street noise at night)Make sure to spend some time exploring the neighborhood within several blocks of the Ungherese and you will be rewarded with a view of attractive homes, some with fabulous roses.
