We chose it for its good location(near to many major sights) and for the good local transport to be found right near the hotel, taking you all across Berlin and to the various airports.The hotel is in the middle of a big shopping area and is opposite the famous television tower. Yes, it is a big hotel but we found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 16th floor with a lovely view over the square and tower. Everything was very modern and yes, the bathroom is a little strange, but it was a very comfortable room and the only down side is once again the lack of storage space. There was a good wardrobe but no drawer space - you can't hang everything in a wardrobe! Ask for a room overlooking the shopping square. If you get one on the side of the main entrance you'll be looking at a building site. Note that Berlin seems to be one big building site as construction work is going on everywhere you look.We had breakfast included and there was a lot of choice on offer, mainly cold dishes, but a few warm ones too. It was all very tasty but you obviously need to get a deal with breakfast included. I would never do otherwise.In the evening the hotel offered a very good buffet of starters, main courses, salads, desserts and cheese - as much as you wanted for 19 Euros! I think this was a bargain in a capital city.Sightseeing tours leave from opposite the main entrance and take you past the main sights in Berlin and as it's a big city it's worth doing on your first visit to Berlin.We were pleased with the overall service in this hotel and would certainly consider going again.
