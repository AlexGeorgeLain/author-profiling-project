The main reason we booked the hotel was because of all of the rave reviews it received from other Trip Advisor users. Frankly, we do not understand what all the hype is about. The superior double room was clean, with a good size bed. However, the room was in need of paint and sprucing up. The service we received was nothing special and actually, the day staff was not that helpful. The breakfast was adequate, nothing more. It did not vary at all from day to day. Most importantly, there is something lacking in atmosphere. In fact, the hotel, although colorful and artsy, is still kind of cold. The location is the best part of the hotel!
