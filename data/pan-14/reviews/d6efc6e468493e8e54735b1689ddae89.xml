The hotel is easily accessable, very presentable, all staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the piano bar is a very pleasant place to relax in the evenings and the rooms are all very nice with extensive views of the city.The only downside to this hotel was that internet access in the computer room in the lobby was not free for guests. There are cables in the rooms but we didnt have laptops on holiday.I would reccomend this hotel and would go back again.
