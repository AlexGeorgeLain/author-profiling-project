The Oberoi met with our unanimous approval, quiet ,great location,traditional Balinese lanai and villas ,great staff, interesting food particularly with the indian influence of Oberoi.DVD hire for the kids,Tennis Gym and Beach all in good order.Clientel kept themselves to themselves( As we like it!) mostly European with a few ex pats.Hawkers on the Beach seemed oddly away from the property, it was almost like they knew to keep the guests to themselves if you wanted to buy the kites, watches or sarongs then a 2 minute walk along the beach got you mobbed!They arranged car hire for us with a local company called Jalan Jalan, good rates and people carrier- Watch out for the motor bikes!The Conrad was very new , very large and when we were there full of Japanese, The Four Seasons was cracking, great villas and secluded location and would be my choice for service but not great for kids as you can go all day with not seeing anybody other than room service and house keeping, when we were there they could not get us connecting villas.The Ritz Carlton is a very large Japanese dominated hotel set up for weddings etc, we had the 3 bedroom villa , great views from the cliffs, great sunsets the kids loved the slides- Food was only OK and what was annoying was that the view from the 'top villa' was interupted one evening by a wedding dinner on the lawns and the second night by a intimate dinner for two in a lanai on the cliffs, what they made of my 4 kids watching from our pool god only knows!Bali is a gem, recovering from the bomb and very friendlyDo go there
