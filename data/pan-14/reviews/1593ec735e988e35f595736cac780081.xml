This is not a five star hotel in its current state. The location is great, the staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms are very nice but the noise from the construction above our room 316 was a nightmare. Drilling, hammering, sawing, cutting you name it started at 9am and I don't know what time it ended at because we just had to leave the room. We had planned to stay in this hotel for two more nights but we moved to a great 4 star hotel called Hotel Jazz on Pelai at 170 euro a night versus 225 at Le Meridien. If its value for money and five stars your looking for do not stay at Le Meridien during construction.
