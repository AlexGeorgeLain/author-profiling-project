We had a good-sized room with two double beds. The room was freshly decorated with yellow walls and nice white, carved crown molding. There were large windows in both the bedroom and spacious bathroom that opened onto an interior coutyard (not very attractive but the fresh air was great!). By Paris standards the bath was huge. The hotel is located in the 15th just a short walk from the Eiffel Tower. It is on a quiet street only a block from shopping, restaurants and the metro. The hotel staff was very gracious and helpful. We have stayed in several 3 star hotels in Paris and this is the best by far. The metro station was great as it had access to several lines. We will definitely stay again.
