Consensus: Solid condo hotel w/ enormous rooms good amenities. But not luxurious, as some guidebooks claim. Very good overall.Positives:(1) Enormous living space(2) Excellent ocean views(3) Good-sized lanai(4) Free wired internet(5) Free, friendly valet(6) Washer/dryer in unit(7) 2x daily maid service(8) Bridged twin beds convert to king(9) Kid-friendly pool (3' to 5' deep)(10) Good coupon book on arrival for Polynesian Cult. Ctr, Bowfin(11) Free sandpails for kids(12) Free room upgrade, 1/2 bottle of sparkling (Korbel) Godiva chocolates for seniors(13) Free daily paper (Honolulu Advertiser)(14) Service very good overall(15) Some luxury appointments (Bose Wave radio in living room, 3 TVs, DVD player, cordless phone)Negatives:(1) Needs update soon; everything in lobby shows wear; rooms also show some wear. Tile (not granite) counters; old cabinetry; popcorn ceilings.(2) Limited common area/lobby (3) Not in the same class Ritz, Four Seasons, or even a high-end Marriott or Hyatt. (4) 1 bad service experience. Check-in person rudely responded, Where do you get these ideas? when asked if he could bridge the twin beds. Of course, housekeeping bridged beds following day. He also neglected to provide sandpails or passes for kids and hesitated about confirming crib setup.
