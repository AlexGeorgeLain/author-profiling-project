We have just returned form an 8 night stay at the Handlery - and cant believe people are moaning about this hotel! We did stay in a club room - and they are of a very good size and i think the regualr rooms are quite a bit smaller - but this is the norm for San Francisco!!! Plus in the Club you get bath robes, extra bathroom amenities, fridge - prob not very important things but it adds to the stay. The rooms are nicely decorated too, and clean! Cant really rememeber any staff been rude (apart from one of the Valet guys so all we did was give a tip to the nice polite valet instead!)- but in all honesty its not something i really take into consideration when booking a hotel - I think far more important is location and considering this hotel is a stones throw from Union Square, is it really that important that the staff arent kissing your preverbial??!!! Next time I visit I know exactly where I will be staying!!
