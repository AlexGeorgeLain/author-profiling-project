This was after e-mail contact and a phone call with my credit card. They wanted me to come back for a 3:00 check in. They stored my luggage and the hotel is within walking distance to EVERYTHING downtown, so it wasn't a big deal. When I got back at 3 though, I don't think my original room was ready yet, but they gave me a room on the 6th floor on the side street (above the theatre, perhaps?) No view, but the side street allowed me to have the window open all night (no air conditioning- it's alright!)That being said, this is an awesome hotel with friendly staff and people staying there, and it's right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, so the location can't be beat. A car is not needed. Walking and busing got me everywhere I needed to go! I travelled solo (29-year-old male) and felt completely safe everywhere I went, but it you are a nervous traveller, this might not be the place for you. Rooms were simple, the age of the building gave it some character. Appreciated the fan in the room- wouldn't have slept as well without it. I would stay again next time in Seattle!

I was there primarily for the Brewers, and this hotel was one of the closer ones to Maryvale park and the freeway. We didn't spend much time at our hotel. It's not fancy, and they seemed to be doing some renovations. That said, the full breakfast buffet (waffles!), location and outdoor hottub were enough for me to stay there again this upcoming March. Yes, you get what you pay for, and there's not a lot within a 5 minute drive (or walk) but like anywhere else in Phoenix, there's lots within a 10-15 minute drive. Including an awesome Mexican restaurant that I can't remember the name or location for the life of me. I'll find it though!
