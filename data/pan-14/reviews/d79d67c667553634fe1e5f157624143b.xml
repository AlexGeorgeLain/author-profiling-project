The hotel staff were uniformly friendly and helpful and most spoke excellent English. The restaurants were pricy and in our experience (coffee shop and Chinese restaurant) the food was good, but not great.The internet wireless connection was free and worked well.For a hotel that seemed as American as this one I was surprised that there wasn't a coffee maker in the room.
