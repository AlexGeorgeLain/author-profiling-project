Good Quality Rooms, Friendly Staff I took my girlfriend here in December '04 for a weekend break on birthday, and i am pleased to say that i was very happy with my choice of hotel.The hotel is in a excellent location, situated on a quiet street which is less than 1 minutes walk from the bustling Las Ramblas, and with it being right in the centre only 2-3mins walk from Playa Catalunya (One of the main centres in Barcelona, from which you can catch the turist buses and service buses). Also within 5mins walking distance was the shopping area.I was also pleased with the room, it was very clean and modern. It also hade a double bed rather than the annoying 2 singles pushed together. The only possible complaint i would have with the room was that it was very warm and the Air Conditioning didnt seem to do much, altho we came to the conclusion that they may have had the heating on in the hotel as to the staff 20 degrees in December may be cold (judging by the amount of spaniads wearing thick coats). Not a major point but just bear in mind if going in Summer.The staff were very pleasant and helpful, whenever we asked them anything.So overall i would say that this hotel is well worth staying in, and definatley one i would stay in again.
