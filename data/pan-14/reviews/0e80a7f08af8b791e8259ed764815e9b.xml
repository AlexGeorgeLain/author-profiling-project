I did call and confirm directly with the motel, after booking, that our room was non-smoking and had two beds, rather than hope they got the Hotwire order correct. Plenty of parking. Desk clerk was very helpful at check-in. Room was clean but spartan, beds were comfortable but not exceptional. Plenty of hot water. Pool was very clean and inviting but we did not swim. Breakfast was plentiful (hard-boiled eggs, juice, milk, coffee, fruit, biscuits, pasteries, yogurt) but again, not exceptional. Overall, an excellent value for the area.
