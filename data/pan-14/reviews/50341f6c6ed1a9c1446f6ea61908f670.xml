The room itself was small but clean and comfortable. The bathroom, however, was small and not terribly clean. The shower (no tub) did not drain properly and was so small that when showering ones nose is pressed against the shower wall. This is not OK when the shower wall is visibly unclean. The breakfast was quite good and filling. The Staff was very pleasant but not especially helpful. I do not consider this to be a 4 star hotel or worth the price. However, the view was worth the other disappointments.
