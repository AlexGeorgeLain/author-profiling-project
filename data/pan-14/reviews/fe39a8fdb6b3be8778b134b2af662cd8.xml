The hotel replied they would do their best to grant our wish. On arrival we were offered a room on the ground floor some distance from the reception desk and next to a lavatory, with a french window going out unto a narrow inside court. The room was dark even in mid-afternoon. When we complained it was pointed out to us with silky smoothness that they had only promised us a room. As rooms were allocated on a daily basis and this was the only one available of that category they were entirely justified and we were utterly wrong in complaining. As an alternative we were offered a standard (i.e. small) room and a suite at a 10 per cent discount. We left next morning.
