Prior to my arrival I had flown from my home in Australia to London, New York and Chicago. In each of these locations I stayed in Sofitel Hotels all of which are rated very highly by Tripadvisor. From my perspective Le Pavillon was equal to or better than any of these Hotels. Absolutely everything exceeded my expectations. I had such a great time in this wonderful city and at Le Pavillon that I have just re-booked to return to the Hotel for the two weeks of Jazz Fest in 2008. The Hotel truly is the 'Belle of New Orleans'
