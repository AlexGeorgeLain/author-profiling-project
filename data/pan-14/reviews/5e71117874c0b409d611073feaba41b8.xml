First of all if you are offered the chance to stay in the 'Apartments' (for want of a better word) then decline them, We were offered them and the way the staff speak it sounds like this is an upgrade, it is far from it. The apartments are small, shabby and dont look safe at all. We changed rooms and the room was average, although I have stayed in better rooms in Best Western hotels before. The main bugbear was that there was no mini bar. When we were at reception we overheard a couple who had had their bags stolen including credit cards etc just moments before we arived, For this reason we used the safe in the room and to be safe put the sign on the door so that the rooms wernt cleaned. A small price to bay for the safety of our belongings. To be fair the hotel lobby and bar looked quite posh and the concierge was happy to help. But I dont reccomend this hotel, there are probably better ones for the same price!
