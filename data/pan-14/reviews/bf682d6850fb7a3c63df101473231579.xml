We booked this property to be able to enjoy the Magic Castle for my birthday and were not dissapointed! I recently read a negative review and wonder if that guest and I were at the same hotel!This 'botique' hotel was formerly a small apartment complex delightfully converted to a hotel that allows their guests access to the famous Magic Castle (fees required but worth every penny if you're a fan of magic). We found our one bedroom suite most welcoming. It was clean, freshly painted and the linens divine. Yes, we've stayed at much newer, more modern properties, but NONE with such OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! FREE (yes, free) snacks for the asking....soft drinks, water, candy bars, etc. Breakfast included the most delicous scones ever made among other choices. This property would be a super bargain for a travelling family to the Hollywood area. Its central location and spacious accommodations allow one to save $ by cooking in.We are local southern Californians and were only interested in attending the Castle until our arrival. The concierge enthusiastically provided a walking tour map and lots of local information. A real tourist's delight. Although I've not checked rates for similar properties, we found this place a pretty good deal! If you want Ritz attention roomy accommodations, this is the place.
