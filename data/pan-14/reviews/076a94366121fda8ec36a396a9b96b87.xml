This stay was only for three days, but we found that everything was still the same. The owner/manager, Christine Caroff, is friendly and helpful. The rooms, while not large, are adequate and very clean; the location is good, with Metro and bus links close by; and it is only a short walk in any direction to find good restaurants. The hotel's breakfast is very good, buffet style, and the price is less than what you would pay outside the hotel. We have walked, at a 'tourist' pace from the hotel to the Eiffel Tower (that covers most of the sights on the Left Bank) in about an hour and a half. This hotel has everything that the traveller is looking for: clean rooms, good food, reasonable price, great location, and friendly staff. We hope to return to the Carofftel Gobelins again.
