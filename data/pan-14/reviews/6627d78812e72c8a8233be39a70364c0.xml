The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste, but it wasn't uncomfortable. The location was good, a short walk to the Xidan subway station and shopping area. It's about a mile west of Tiananmen Square. Since a subway ticket is about 30 cents and taxis are quite cheap and efficient, location may or may not be a major factor, however. Service was very attentive and courteous. The facilities (pool, gym, jacuzzi, locker room, Cafe Marco) were very nice. I would stay in this hotel again.
