Provided full breakfast and is close to shops and eateries. Not much of a view from my window due to being so close to other buildings. Don't bring heavy luggages since the reception desk is a second floor walk-up. Since Florence was small, I was able to walk everywhere from my hotel. Considered value for the price paid
