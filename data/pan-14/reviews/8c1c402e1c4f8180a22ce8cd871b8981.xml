We had a deal which included evening meal on the first night and then two night's bed and breakfast. The Hotel staff were very efficient. The evening meal was good. Full English breakfast (buffet style) was excellent. We found the location very good. It is accessible on the London Underground via a shopping centre at Canary Wharf which was only a 5 minute walk away. We also used the Docklands Light Railway which we could use with our underground 3 day pass. This is right next to the hotel.Would use this hotel again.
