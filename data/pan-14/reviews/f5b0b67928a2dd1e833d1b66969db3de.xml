Not a five star at all, it looks kind of shabby and a bit dirty if you ask me. My bathroom was lacking some maintainance and I bet you cannot say you're happy when you pay for your car to be parked at the hotel you're staying in. Kind of annoying to find not very helpful people at front desk. Super expensive for what you get, would have liked to pay much more if i'd had known it will be such a waste. Anyway, it has a great location and that made things easier. Wish i had heard about all costs before calling in though.
