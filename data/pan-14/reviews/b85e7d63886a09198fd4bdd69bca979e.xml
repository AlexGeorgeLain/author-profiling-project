The best part of the place is the pool -- it's a full 25 meters and very clean. There's lots of vegetation surrounding it and a bar as well. It opens at 6 am if you like to swim early. Great atmosphere. We brought dinner back to the pool area and just ate there. No problem bringing your own drinks to the pool. We didn't use it but there's a coffee shop right there in the hotel that seemed very reasonable.The location is very convenient to Universal Studios. You can drive there in about ten minutes or you can take the hotel shuttle. There's lots of restaurants nearby and plenty of quick eats or take out. There are also a couple of supermarkets close by.My only complaint is that the room did not have a refrigerator in it. There seemed to be space for one but it wasn't there. Could have used it.We stayed two nights and I booked the room through the Universal Studios package web site and saved $30 or $40 per night over booking direct. I could have stayed more than two nights here - we were very comfortable.
