After reading the reviews here we asked for a room on one of the higher floors and we were given a room on the 9th floor which was very quiet. Clean, comfortable room, no bath but that didn't matter. Hotel staff were very helpful, gave us maps of New York and advised us about trains etcThe free 24hr coffee is very welcome, breakfast great. We'd told the hotel we were in New York to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary and champagne and chocolates were waiting for us in our room when we arrived.We had a wonderful time in New York and would stay here again!

All very clean, staff great and we could see the CN Tower from our window. No problems getting around, we walked to most places and also had a pass for the hop on hop off bus. Breakfast was great, especially the option to take it back to your room. The lemonade available in the lobby area each afternoon was also very welcome after a day of walking. Would stay here again!
