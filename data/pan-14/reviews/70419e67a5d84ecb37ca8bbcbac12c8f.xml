This is the first time in Barcelona for both of us and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel Regencia Colon was our choice for our stay and proved to be a good choice. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean with everything required for a comfortable stay. The bathroom was bright and fluffy towels provided every day. In seven nights our bed was changed four times. The restaurant for breakfast didnot inspire us so we ate out at a small cafe just across the square. The hotel is really well placed for all the tourist attractions, bars, restaurants, shops, and metro. There was building work going on at the corner of the street but we were on the fifth floor and all work stopped around 5.30pm so there was no problem. The hotel kept our luggage for us on the last day and arranged a taxi to the airport for us which pleased us. Barcelona is a beautiful city but watch your wallets and purses. We found eating out in the evenings expensive but we did use what we considered the nicer places. The bus and metro system are really good for getting around. Our stay was Easter 2005.
