A high quality hotel with a good standard of accommodation and facilities, and in an excellent position for walking to most of the main sights of the city. The rooms are only medium sized but recently refurbished, well equipped and very comfortable. Any item taken out of the mini-bar is automatically charged to your account via electronic detectors - even if you put it back; but the reception staff are very understanding if you make this mistake. In fact the staff were always very courteous and helpful. My only gripe is that breakfast, at 23 Euros, was pricey - excellent quality and loads of it, but if you only want or can only manage a small breakfast then it is not good value, and we found really good breakfasts with personal service at local cafes (notably Mohring and Dressler).
