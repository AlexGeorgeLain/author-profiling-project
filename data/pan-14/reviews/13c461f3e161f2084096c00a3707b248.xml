I'll second every positive thing that others have written and add that we had none of the problems mentioned by other reviewers - the walking was fine and necessary to work off all of the food we ate, I saw no mosquitos, none of us got sick. The rooms were just fine and buffets met everybody's needs. US Air was on time and there were no problems in the airport. GO's were there to meet us and we were on the beach by 1 pm.One caveat- don't buy any of the palm frond baskets or hats which are sold in the bar and reception area. They will be confiscated at the airport!
