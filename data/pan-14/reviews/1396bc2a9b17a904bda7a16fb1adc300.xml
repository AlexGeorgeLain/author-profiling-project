There is so much about the Grosvenor that is simply 5 star: unbelievable views that any top of the line hotel would die for; nice layout of a small one bedroom apartment that was more than spacious for three of us; some tasteful updates like granite and modern fixtures in the very small bathroom; a fabulous location that really makes it easy to take advantage of everything San Francisco offers. And then there are some things that are strictly 1 star: chipped paint on window sills that have been repaired with mismatched paint; a crack in the window; tears in the linings of drapes; grimy door and window jambs; piled on grease on the exhaust fan in the kitchenette (so much that I wouldn't use the rangetop); a really suspect bedspread; broken heating covers. If it had not been for the 5 star elements, we would have checked out instantly. Gratefully, Housekeeping did an awesome job with daily cleaning, but really basic, quality maintenance is needed. Another reviewer said that this is not a luxury hotel and that is right on the money. The lovely rooms shown on their website are long term rentals only so be prepared for something less. If the units are maintained as they should be, there is no question that the Grosvernor Suites would be the best deal in town. I guess the bottom line is: would we stay again? ONLY if I researched all other options, and had the assurance from management that we would once again have the incredible views that make up for the inside of the unit.
