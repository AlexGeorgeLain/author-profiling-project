The check-in process went smoothly, and the staff were great. My room was on the 9th floor, looking out toward the runway/airport (there was very little noise from the planes). The decor and furnishings were very classy and bed was plush comfortable. Because I had visited the hotel's website, I had slightly higher expectations about the degree of luxury and grandness.... the room was very nice but not as amazing as the website represented. Overall, I'd give the hotel 4 out of 5 stars, and would likely return.

Holiday Inn Port of Miami Downtown is the closest hotel to Bayside Market and to the Port of Miami. The hotel itself was what you would expect from a typical Holiday Inn/Hampton Inn/Comfort Inn, etc. Nothing in the hotel blow me away, but I definitely can't give any negative criticism. The check-in process was great, and the room was nicely layed out large. My room was on the 10th floor and looked out on the Bayside Market (amazing view of Biscayne Bay and the causeways). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would return there myself.
