Check in was very quick, was offered an upgrade to a room with a view to St. Patrick's Cathedral. However, we turned it down because we would have had to forgo our king bed. The room is big enough, a little smaller than something you would find in Vegas, but large for NY standards. Nice bathroom with some lux marble accents. I loved the 42 plasma screen tv. Upon arrival we found that the foyer light in our room was not working. On our way out to walk around the city we told the concierge about the problem, when we came back a couple of hours later, it was fixed, very quick response time. We skipped room service and any meal at the hotel and must have saved hundreds of dollars, except for the $18 dollar drinks (berry patches) we had at GUILT, the hotel restaurant and bar. Yes, we felt guilty (pun intended) afterwards. All in all it was a great stay, the location itself justifies the price of the room. You are literally in the middle of it all.
