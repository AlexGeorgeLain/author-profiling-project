(which i certainly didnt need after a 11 hour flight).the hotel was beautiful and the rooms very clean, which i couldnt fault at all. i found the staff a little rude and didnt have a clue about transport around the area.it is easy to use the metro(train) and bus(very frequent and cheap). The area was full of tramps and groups of youths hanging about(but no trouble). the area was being upgraded and lots of building work taking place but nothing open after 8pm and nothing to do, you have to travel to see anything, but the metro is easy and convenient to use.
