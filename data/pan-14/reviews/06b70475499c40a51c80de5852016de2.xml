I booked a room for my boyfriend and I, and we were delighted to find that they had upgraded us to a suite with two balconies and the most amazing view! Needless to say, the service was perfect the entire time. From the front desk, to the doorman and incredibly helpful concierge the service was impeccable. Everyone was genuinely friendly, kind and efficient.The hotel itself feels new, upscale, and somewhat contemporary. Although the rooms are small, they are tastefully furnished and the bathroom was marble, tile and gorgeous. Our view and location was the most perfect we could have dreamed of. We will definitely be back and wouldn't imagine being in Florence in any other hotel.As an extra aside, one day the concierge reserved a Mercedez with driver and guide. His name was Fabrizio and he took us to the Chianti region, where we had lunch and wine tasting at a vineyard in the hills. Yes, it was as perfect as it sounds.Thank you to the manager, Simone, and to the staff. The Savoy was our favorite hotel during our trip to Italy and France. And this review comes from a traveler who wouldn't stay at any less than a five star.
