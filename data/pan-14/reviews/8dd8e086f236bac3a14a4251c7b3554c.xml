This wasnot the first all-inclusive we have visited but it was one of the best.We did not pay for the Royal Service and everything was great. Our room was beautiful with a sitting room, king size bed, large bathroom with a huge jacuzzi tub, separate shower, flat screen TV, stereo, safe, ironing board iron and a mini bar. The minibar was always kept stocked with plenty of soft drinks, beer water. There was water in the bathroom to use for brushing yourteeth (They tell you not to drink the tap water). The bed was very comfortable. The food was good with buffets for breakfast and lunch. The other restaurants for dinner was great. Passions was our favorite with the lobster being a great choice. We did nothave time to eat at Bana, but other people we met said it was great. The bars were all good. Everyone was very friendly, the grounds were immaculate w/ lots of shade on the beach. Not alot of shopping, some shops on the beach past the resorts where you can bargain for t-shirts, etc. There is a new shoppingplaza at the main entrance to the resort but there were only about10 shops open so far. They are building a Hard Rock Cafe thereand had already opened the gift shop. We took 2 excursions:Marinarium (great crew but too many people trying to snorkle) Outback Safari (great trip, would do this again - bought greatcoffee cocoa on this trip - cheap too).
