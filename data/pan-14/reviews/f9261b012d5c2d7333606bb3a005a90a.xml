The hotel does not have an airport shuttle so we paid for a taxi (around $45).Being tired, we were pleased with the swift check-in. The first impressions of the hotel were good, a nice modern lobby with sealed off garden area, a very nice and spacious room with great view of the rest of LA from the 15th floor. The swimming pool was small but never had more than 5 people so a brilliant place to relax. The gym was very modern. The lady at the concierge, Amy, was extremely helpful and friendly, even at the busy times ensuring that she was acknowledging everyone waiting. The bellman was also great...we were walking out of the hotel to go buy a plug adapter, but he insisted on getting one for us, he didn't even take any money. So as well as the hotel being great, we were mightily impressed with staff.Even though the hotel is in downtown, we were slightly disappointed with the location being there as a tourist. The plaza next to the hotel was not lively, with only a Starbucks. However, the metro station is only a 5 minute walk and very cheap, around $1 if I remember correctly. It will take you direct to the Walk of Fame, Universal Studios, etc. The Universal Studios area was great, as the restaurant and bar area is extremely lively at all times, reminding me of Piccadily Circus in London.Overall, the Omni is a great hotel. Comfortable and good facilties although as a tourist, I would have preferred to stay in a hotel in the Universal Studios area, as it is still cheaper than W.Hollywood/Hollywood, closer to the main sites and has is lively all the time. Whether the hotels there are good or not I'm not sure!!
