Staff were friendly and helpful. Eddy Luna made our stay especially enjoyable. If you stay here, book your shuttle when you book the room as it is busy with airport traffic as well. As we hate driving in large cities, we ordered pizza for supper. A local pizzeria suggested by Eddy at the front desk brought the best pizza we've had in a long while. There were also re-heatable foods available in the lobby for reasonable prices. The breakfast was more than adequate. The lobby and breakfast room were both large and comfortable. We would definitely use this hotel if we were in the area again.
