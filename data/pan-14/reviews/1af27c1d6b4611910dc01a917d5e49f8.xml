The front desk clerk at the Marquis (Delores) was quick, efficient and pleasant and allowed an early check in. Multiple elevator trips and NO problems experienced! The rooms were excellent. I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit the city and wants to stay in Times Square.
