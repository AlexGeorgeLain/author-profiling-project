Very decadent!The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly.The breakfast was amazing. The best buffet breakfast I have experienced. Asian and american, somuch to choose from and a chocolate fountain with fruit and donuts as you left the restaurant to patake in shopping, shopping, shopping or tours.The ladies market is just a block away, fantastic location and hotel attahced to shopping mall. Bought lots of MAC cosmetics in the department store at a cheap price.Overall a fantastic shopping and hotel experience.
