The cab from the airport cost $25, which is pretty reasonable for Sydney.This hotel is a good budget option. There are no frills, but its hard to complain with the standard of the rooms. Our room was big for the price, with a good bathroom. There was a fridge and a microwave in the room, together with an iron and ironing board. The only thing we could really complain about was that the bed was hard, but that's really being picky.Its a great option if you're looking for something inexpensive in Sydney, in a pretty handy spot. We were there on a weekend, and it was very busy. Its obviously popular with travel groups.The staff were great, despite the place being really busy.Don't expect the Ritz, but this place is fine if you're only going to be in the room to sleep.
