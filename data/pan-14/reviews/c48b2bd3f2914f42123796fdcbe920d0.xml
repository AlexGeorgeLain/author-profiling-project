Hotel room was sub par buffet was sub par, alacartes were average, pools and beach were superberb But then i am comparing to resorts we have spent 5 times as much at . Overall a good value... dont drink local water Hotel is good to supply bottled water everywhere in the hotel and your room. Maid service was really lax.
