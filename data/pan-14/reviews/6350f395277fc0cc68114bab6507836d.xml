The rates were fantastic for midtown (granted early January is not the hot tourist season, but it was unseasonably warm - in the 60's and 70's) and the valet parking reasonable. The room was comfy and clean and the memory foam pillow I requested was in the room when I checked in.The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean and well appointed and the walls soundproof.Without question, the strong point of all the Affinia Hotels I've stayed in is the service. The staff of the Affinia 50 is welcoming, personable and unobtrusive. This is how hotels should be.

I stayed at the Hilton becuase it was the best rate I could find at a decent hotel, but I expected an impersonal feel (big chain hotel in such a touristy spot) - I couldn't have been more wrong. My room was large, airy and comfortable and was on a higher floor with a stunning view of the Empire State Building and the Hudson. The staff was pleasant, helpful and personable. Housekeeping was great (it may have been because I left tips, but they kept leaving extra toiletries and chocolates).
