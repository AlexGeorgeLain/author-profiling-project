The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. We had late night drinks at the bar on several occasions; had a late night dinner in their restaurant; and ate breakfast each morning, also in the bar. Each time was perfect. Great drinks, food, coffee, croissants. The location was ideal to explore all the Washington sights. We did a lot of walking and also made use of the nearby subway. Though this is hardly an inexpensive place, it was a delight. We even met the French ambassador during our stay. There are a lot of French people who not only work at the hotel, but stay at the hotel. The room was large and nicely decorated. Would stay here again...absolutely.
