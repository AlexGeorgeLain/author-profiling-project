Its a great hotel in a great location. The staff were fantastic and very helpful and I felt very welcome. The location of the hotel is about 100 meters away from the flower market which leads onto the main shopping streets up to Dam Square - a great location. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone and will use this hotel everytime I return to Amsterdam.
