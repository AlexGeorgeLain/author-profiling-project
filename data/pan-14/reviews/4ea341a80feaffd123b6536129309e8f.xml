We do travel alot but are not snobs. There is the backround and this is what you need to know about the resort. I hope it helps. 1. The beach and water are absolutely amazing. You will not be disappointed in this or the weather.2. The pools are clean, warm, and the pool bar area is awesome.3. Building 7 is new and the room itself is very nice. However our air conditioning did not work so there was a moldy smell in our room the whole time. 4.The food was not very good. If you go in with low expectations you will be ok. The breakfast buffet was good, the lunch on the beach was average and the dinners were awful. A previous poster said that the buffet pasta was better than the Italian restaurant and he was absolutely correct. The Tex-Mex place was practically inedible as the beef there is definately different than what most Americans will be used to so beware. We stayed at Excellence in Cancun last year and the food was 5 star. FYI there is an Excellence in Punta Cana.5. There is no top shelf liquor and your fridge in your room will be not so cold and stocked with only 2 beers and some cokes.6. The previous poster are correct in that the multi ball roulette game is a complete scam. Stay Away. Thank God I pulled the plug after losing only $200.00. Bottom line to this place is if your looking to relax all day at beautiful beach and/or pool on nice grounds this can be the place for you. However do not expect good food and just hope your air conditoning works. We had a great time here but would definately go to Excellence Punta Cana the next time.
