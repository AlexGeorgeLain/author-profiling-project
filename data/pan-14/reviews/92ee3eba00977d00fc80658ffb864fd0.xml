The views of the city and marina with sunsets are spectacular. The staff from the bellman, to valet to checkin desk were ready to help and welcome you to the hotel. Our suite was great and the baths in each bedroom were unbelievable - I've stayed in hotel rooms that were the size of these baths. They were the same in both master suites - extremely spacious with 2 sink vanity. One side was a large jetted soak tub. Other side of room was a separate toilet with door and a separate walkin shower (quite large). Also a huge closet with soft bathrobes and disposable slippers for your use. Nice touch with the marble floors that were chilly. Living area was quite large with a table and chairs for in room dining plus a long sofa that was very comfortable. Wrap around windows that gave an oceanfront view and a marina view.Also a real nice touch that you don't see often in high rises hotels - windows that actually opened but were chest high so as not to pose a danger to children. My family with me had never stayed in suites like this and their chins hit the floor when we walked in.
