Although it is not in the city center, the location is perfect, because you can walk everywhere. To give you an idea, the Van Gogh museum is just two blocks away, the fashion district 300 metres. The breakfast is abundant, and there is a supermarket in the Museumplein and several restaurants and take aways in the neighbourhood.
