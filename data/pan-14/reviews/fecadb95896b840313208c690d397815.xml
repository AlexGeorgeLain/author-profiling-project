Also, we, as seniors travelling light, had no difficulty walking to the train station, perhaps ten minutes distant. Gassem and Miriam (management) were most helpful and solicitous, and spoke excellent English, too. Our bedroom and bath accommodations were clean and comfortable, and the breakfast spread was good. The Europa was our best value on our trip, which also included stopovers in Verona, Venice and Rome. I will recommend the Europa to my friends.
