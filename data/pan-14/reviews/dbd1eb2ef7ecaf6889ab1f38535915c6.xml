The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The food was good. The best part would have to be the Entertainment Team. They were so friendly and very funny. They always made sure everyone was having a good time. My Boyfriend and I loved; Will Smith (Richard), Spaghetti, James Bond, Breaker, and the rest of them were also very good. They all work very well together and they are out the whole day. They also had excellent shows every single night. All in all we had a FANTASTIC stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.
