We chose it because of the great location and 15% seasonal discount they offered for the month of January.From the moment we pulled up in the cab it was a wonderful experience. We were made to feel so welcome here. The staff were so friendly and accomodating. Check in took about 30 seconds and our bags were up to our room in 5 minutes.We stayed in a Premier room on the 33rd floor with an amazing view of the Empire State Building. The room was surpisingly spacious even with three very messy girls in it. The beds were really comfy but strangely small - the smallest double beds I've ever seen but they were fine and we all slept well!It was spotlessly clean and well maintained. The bed and bathroom linens were fresh and new. The only problem we experienced was that the room was very hot and the AC didn't make much difference. However with the windows open it was fine. The flat panel tv was cool and had lots of stations.We got room service a few times and it was delicious, albeit expensive. The location was great, the 7 and Times Square Shuttle was a block away and there was loads of restaurants and delis around. The best deli is PAX right next door - lovely staff! Also the Comfort Diner on 45th St is great for breakfast. Also, this hotel seems to be very popular with airlines - we saw pilots and cabin crew from Alitalia and Virgin and some others staying there.I can't recommend this hotel enough and can't wait to return!
