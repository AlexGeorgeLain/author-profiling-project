Visit the city from this hotel is easy, Transport facilities like underground (6 lines) and bus stops are along Rambla near the hotel. Rooms are large and clean. Reception services are good, you can leave your luggage in hotel after check-out without problems (your bags will be stored in a closed room and identified by a personal number). The restaurant is lightly expensive but nearly there are several kind of restaurants (Tapas bar, pizzeria, ecc.). Great hotel,I'll return.
