My previous stay there was for 4 nights in 2003.This is probably the finest hotel I have stayed at. The staff's attention to detail was impeccable. The bell hops, valet drivers, and front desk, all were very hospitable.The room was modern, well appointed and generally very comfortable. I enjoy boutique style hotels, as the Palomar is and it did not fail to disappoint. This room had a Market St. view which was also nice.My only regret was that we only stayed for a single night!Getting a discount rate on such a great hotel was excellent!Valet parking was a bit hefty, however I know parking is expensive in San Francisco.I hope to stay at the Palomar on my next visit to San Francisco!
