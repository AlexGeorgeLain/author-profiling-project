It's a lovely hotel in a very good location for cafes, restaurants and shopping. The area around is nice and quiet. Great location for touring the Latin Quarter. Staff are very friendly. We had a lovely room and there is a cosy room downstairs beside the bar. Could not find one fault with this hotel. Have stayed in other hotels in Paris before which were terrible. Will return to Luxembourg Parc again. Highly recommend it.
