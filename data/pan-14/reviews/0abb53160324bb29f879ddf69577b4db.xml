This is a really great property with nice pools and an amazing private island (really one of the prettiest places I have ever seen) but I say don't forget the sunscreen because if you do, it's gonna cost you. $20 to be exact. Yep, if you forget anything while you are staying here you better be prepared to pay dearly for it. Oh, and if you want to eat, you better be willing to pay up, big time. I am no cheapie, but $16 for a burger was a little high and almost $20 for two well drinks was a bit over the top! I loved this place, but make sure you bring LOTS of extra cash for food, drinks, parking etc. and try not to leave any essentials at home because they charge a ton for little stuff. We had a great view from our room, STAY OCEANFRONT!! It is such a great thing to wake up to! We took our two kids and they loved it, especially the awesome pools. I am glad we stayed here, but really wish there were some sort of affordable food options, there just isn't quite yet.
