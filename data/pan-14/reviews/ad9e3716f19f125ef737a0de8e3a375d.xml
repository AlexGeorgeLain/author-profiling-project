On checking into our room we were shocked to discover what we thought was a curtained window was in fact a small window overlooking a lift shaft, scary to say the least. We enquired if we could change our room but were told by a beligerent receptionist that the hotel was full. On returning to our room we could not help noticing that there was a very bad smell coming from the drain in the toilet. At this point we had not even unpacked. Again we pleaded with the receptionist to please offer us another room. He then called the plumber who in turn informed us the room was uninhabitable. Within half an hour we were given another room which this time had 1 curtain over a small window overlooking an air shaft. The room was very stuffy and quite shabby. After spending 1 night in the hotel Lleo we decided to check out although we had paid for 4 nights. On hearing this we were given another room this time facing the front. We observed that out of 80 rooms the hotel has only12 facing the front. We will certainly return to Barcelona which is a wonderful city but take our advice avoid Hotel Lleo.
