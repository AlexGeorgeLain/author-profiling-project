I booked because the majority of reviews on Trip Advisor were good, but had a few reservations ...a few comments on rude staff and too near the train station for my own personal taste. ( I normally depend on Karen Brown Travels as a guide and this hotel is not listed in her book). The SMN met all our expectations. It was clean, great access, friendly staff, nicely furnished, great bathrooms. The price was very reasonable for the level of accomodation in Florence. It was very quiet, great linens, and there was no problem at all walking around at night. I would highly recommend and would return without a second thought. I had read that the man with the mustache was rude...I did not have that experience at all. I think he is just a bit reserved and was very accomodating. Also interesting to note that the JFK Hotel (highly rated) is just a few doors away (and and extra $100 or so euros a night).
