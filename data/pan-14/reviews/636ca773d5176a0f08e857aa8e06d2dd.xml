Our room on 11th floor overlooked the train tracks but did not disturb us. General air of quiet refinement about hotel. Staff speak excellent english and are extremely attentive. Only took one breakfast in the lobby lounge. Good service and excellent food although a little pricey. There is an excellent coffee shop (Tully's) across the road from the rear exit which is very reasonable and good selection for breakfast. Airport limousine service (which is actually a bus) from hotel. Like everything else in Japan runs exactly on time and is slightly cheaper than Narita Express although marginally longer journey time. Japanese wedding taking place on Saturday in lobby lounge area. Lovely to see!
