The public areas of the hotel are elegant, and the staff friendly and helpful - although not well-trained or efficient. When we inquired about the message light on our phone going on the second morning that we were there, and us not being able to access the message (we were expecting a call from our son who was arriving later that day at the hotel), the day staff at the hotel was not at all quick to try solving the problem and took several hours trying to figure out the code to access the message (it should have been the arrival date, but wasn't) and finally determined that the message was an old message. They couldn't even figure out how to turn off the message light, so it kept on blinking. Finally, in the evening, the desk clerk knew exactly what to do, and fixed the problem in a few seconds.The first room that we were taken to was fairly large, but the air conditioner was obviously being worked on (part of the ceiling insulation was on the floor), and the bellhop immediately called the desk to assign us another room. That room was very small and dark - and not exceptionally clean. The time was getting close to midnight, and after a delayed flight and a time change of four hours, we just wanted to get to sleep.The wine and cheese hour was very nice with a nice selection of wines and cheeses.We love Old San Juan, and El Convento is in a very convenient location. We were able to walk to San Cristobal Fort and took the free trolley to El Morro Fort. The hotel is close to the only remaining city gate. It is also close to lots of shopping.Go to La Bombonera for breakfast (259 Calle San Francisco), and be sure to order a Mallorca. It's about a five minute walk from the hotel.

We thoroughly enjoyed staying in the Pacific Heights area, amongst mansions and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Street parking was readily available - much better than paying the astronomical parking rates at the downtown hotels.The staff was very friendly, helpful, and responsive to all of our requests.Our family had three rooms - two of the rooms were on the lower level and worked well for our adult children and their toddlers. Their rooms were quite large. Our only caveat is to avoid Room 109. We were given that room, which was very large, but it turned out to be too noisy for us since it was off of the main hall, very close to reception, and we were kept awake by conversations of lots of people returning to the hotel in the late late evening. The following morning, we requested a change of room to a quieter location. This request was accommodated quickly and pleasantly. Our luggage was moved to the new room for us. We loved the second room, even though it was smaller than our original room. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms nicely laid out - with lots of mirrors and good lighting. The expanded continental breakfast was excellent. It included oatmeal, cold cuts, cheeses, pastries, breads, and fresh orange juice. The coffee was excellent.In the evening, wine was available in the dining room. We were only able to take advantage of this on one evening, but we found that the wines served were very good.We highly recommend this boutique hotel, and will stay here again the next time that we decide to stay in San Francisco.
