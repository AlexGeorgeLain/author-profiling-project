There were 6 of us, and we were originally booked into a 2bdrm and a 1bdrm, but asked about the 3bdrm when we arrived. Although the 3bdrm is usually only available for a minimum of 2nts, they had one available, and the wonderful concierge was happy to book us in. He even gave us a tour of the 3bdrm vs the 2bdrm before we made up our minds...Well, the 3bdrm definitely won us over, as did the promise of access to the private swimming pool/sauna/spa. We had a great evening and no-one complained about the bedding.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value with the MOST AMAZING views of Sydney harbour. We could see way out over the Heads and out to sea - 2 lots of fireworks went off on the harbour that night - what a treat!
