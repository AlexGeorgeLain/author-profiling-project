I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Bryant Park Hotel.This is a very trendy place to stay and the size of the rooms were certainly well above average for New York. The bathrooms were HUGE and the bath was like a swimming pool!The bedrooms were very well equiped with plasma TV and Bose stereo system.Our room overlooked Bryant Park and was a little noisy on the Saturday evening (why do the cab drivers have to beep their horns all the time?)!! Our friends rooms were on the back of the Hotel and were much quieter, however earplugs were available in each room.Disappointed that there were no recreational areas in the lobby for us to meet up with our friends, in fact the lobby is rather small.We chose not to eat in the Koi Restaurant as there is such a selection of eateries within easy walking distance.We did have a round of drinks in the Cellar Bar but they were extremely expensive so did not pay it a visit again!All in all our stay at the Bryant was most enjoyable and it's location is superb whehter you want to visit New York to shop or to sightsee.
