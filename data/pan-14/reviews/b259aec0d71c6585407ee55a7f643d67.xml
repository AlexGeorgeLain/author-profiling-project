The slanted floor to ceiling windows overlook one of the trendiest neighborhoods in Berlin. There are comfortable black leather seats in the sitting area and a luxurious bed and cedar closets in the sleeping area of the suite.Next door to the hotel, you will find an edgy art and performance space, Tacheles. The buildings were targeted for demolition, but squatters took over. Now there are numerous studios, graffitti covered stairwells, and an outdoor night club with a bonfire. Directly across the street, there is an excellent Singaporan restaurant. I ate there twice. Sit outside under the extraordinarily powerful heatlamps and order something with mango. The historic Neue Synagogue is also close by. If you are taking a taxi cab from anywhere back to the hotel, point to Tacheles on a map. The drivers I met had not yet heard of the brand new Arcotel, but they all knew of Tacheles. There is free Internet access in the hotel lobby bar. My only criticism is that there appeared to be few hotel employees (my room was not made up on Sunday until after 3 p.m. and I was on my own to figure out how to open and close the high tech windows ... uh, duh, by switches on the wall!).At 120 Euros per night, my Junior Suite was an amazing value. I cannot wait to return!
