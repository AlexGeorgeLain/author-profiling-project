I booked the stay based on reviews on TripAdvisor and I was not disappointed.The online booking process was fast and easy. The staff responded by email right away.Our greeting on arrival was warm and friendly. Our rooms were ready, even though we arrived about noon. Everything in the room was spotless,worked perfectly and looked great. We were in room number 7 with a nice view of a garden terrace and the hotel cat sleeping on the chimney.The evening happy hour was a real treat. Light snacks, sandwiches,and pasta dishes were set out on a small buffett in the garden with wine and fruit juices. The garden is a gorgeous spot and a perfect setting to unwind after a day of sightseeing.The staff's recommendations for restaurants were also spot on. We enjoyed two great meals at local spots within walking distance of the hotel.The breakfast was a nice buffett with fresh fruit and pastries, cereals, coffee, tea and delicious blood orange juice.An even better bonus, you can use the hotels internet phone for a free 10 minute call home each night. And the hotel has FREE WI-FI throughout.Overall, a perfect hotel, friendly, comfortable and affordable!
