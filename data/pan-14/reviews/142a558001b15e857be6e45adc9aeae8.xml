The Hilton Times Sq.is welcoming,sophisticated and highly professional. The rooms are spacious,clean and well serviced. The views from our 42nd floor window surpassed expectation even after reading the reviews.So close to the hustle and bustle and life in Times Square yet an oasis of calm sophistication.We will most certainly return to this hotel.
