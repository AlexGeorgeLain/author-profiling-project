The check in clerk was nice, but did not give out cold towels when the people next to me checking had them. The room was a Junior Suite which the hotel was kind enough to make something special for my daughter, who is 12, waiting in our room. The room had no view. The hotel was full due to a wedding over the week-end.We were headed to dinner, and called down for a taxi in 15 minutes, and when we got downstairs, there was no taxi, and we waited another 10 minutes only to get a car which I'm not sure who the driver works for. The funny thing is, we were headed out to dinner around 6:05 pm, and the bellman actually asked if we were walking to the Pier 39 for dinner. I'm not sure about everyone else, but that is a far walk. I run 5 miles 3 times a week, and I still will not walk to Pier 39 in heels especially if we are on our way to dinner.The hotel is really for older generation due to the fact that the swimming pool closed at 9:00 pm among everything else. We had 3 - 12 year old kids, and not a thing to do at the hotel.As for me, this is not the hotel I would ever stay again. First time experience is everything in my book. We do like the Ritz Carlton, but will never stay at the San Francisco Ritz again. We are going back this weekend, and going back to St. Regis where we stayed the other times.Just a note that the concierge at the club lounge jokingly told the 3 kids with me that if they don't behave, then they will be doing dishes for the night. I took this as an insult, and I just told him that I don't think that that is going to happen, and I work too hard in teaching my kids to respect. Like I said the hotel itself is not for teen-age kids.
