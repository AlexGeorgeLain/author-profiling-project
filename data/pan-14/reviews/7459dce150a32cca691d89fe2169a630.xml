Its walking distance to Darling harbour, Sydney Tower, Showboat Dinner cruise departure centre etc. Bridge climb centre i also very close by though not walking distance. The shower is the best i could get in sydney and also the rooms are very spacious. Staff very helpful as well. Breakfast was wonderful. All in all a very good hotel for the price.

Although the location and the rooms are quite good the reception is pathetic. The staff there do not know proper english i am sorry to say. Also the staff at the reception lie a lot. We came to the hotel at 1300 Hrs and enquired if our 2 rooms were avaiable. Only one room was given to us which was acceptable as the normal check in time was 1400 Hrs. However the other room was not given to us till 1530 Hrs. And whenever we spoke to the reception the girl lied to us that the housekeeping staff has not cleaned the room. Actually they were unable to keep the room ready from the earlier passenger. alo once when i checked into the room a housekeeping staff just barged into my room. I was shocked. They still had to do some cleaning of the room which she did and left. Other than this experience the rooms were of OK standard and the location was close to China Town and Darling Harbour.I suggest you this hotel however just beaware of the reception.
