This hotel situated just behind it's posher big sister The Colon Hotel was perfect. The standards of cleanliness and service were second to none. Bed linen and towels were changed daily. The service was both professional and friendly. The staff at the front desk went that little bit further to make our stay so pleasant. Location wise it was perfect, quiet yet central. Have already recommended this to friends
