Will Not hesitate to book here again we went to San francisco Fisherman's Wharf on Dec. 25-30th this year and although the weather did not cooperate with our vacation (it was raining!!) I cannot say the same for the hotel. We got this hotel thru expedia and for the price, it was excellent! Quiet location, helpful staff, near to the wharf, shops, food, etc. What more can one ask for? Check out was a breeze, no hassle at all. The room was a decent size one. They gave us complimentary coffee everyday. We came back every night to a clean well made room.
