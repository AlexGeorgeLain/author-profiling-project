I booked a standard room online (they offer AAA discounts) and then when we arrived, decided to upgrade to a suite for 1/2 the cost, had I booked the suite directly online. for 368RMB we got a suite, two buffet breakfasts, and happy hour every days (which included a selection of hot and cold food, and alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks). the concierge and staff in general are excellent. they all speak fantastic english and are extremely friendly and helpful. the location is fantastic - we walked to the forbidden city on two separate days. you are also walking distance to a fun night market where you get to see numerous items 'on a stick' including scorpions... the hotel arranged for a car for us to mutianyu and we had an excellent day on the great wall. i would definitely stay here again and i highly recommend it!!!!
