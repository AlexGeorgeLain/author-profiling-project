There is a variety of choice for Breakfast - meats, cheeses, cereals, bread rolls, fruit as well as tea, coffee and fruit juices.The hotel's nearest U-Bahn train station is only a couple of minutes walk away, and is approx. 5 stops from Alexanderplatz which seems to be one of the most central areas of the city. There is a TV tower in Alexanderplatz; for 9 euro 50, you can go up to the cafe, which is worth doing, you can see for miles. It is worthwhile getting to the tower early, however, as there is generally a queue.It was our third time in Berlin [the second at Frankfurter Alee Hotel], so had seen the 'touristy bits' ie Checkpoint Charlie before but it was great to still walk around -must have walked miles every day.all in all, it was a great stay, and would certainly consider going to this hotel again.
