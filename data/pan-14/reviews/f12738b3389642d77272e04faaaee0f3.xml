Locationwise, the bars and clubs of Shoreditch are 5mins walk, Brick Lane is 15mins walk and Old St Tube Station is 5mins walk.For value and quality I've not found a hotel in London to match it, and I'll be hoping to use it pretty much every time I need to stay in North London from now on.

I'm not going to repeat everyone else but you can't go wrong with a Club Room and access to the lounge - price includes ALL drinks and food throughout the day in the Club Lounge and the Club rooms are amazing.
