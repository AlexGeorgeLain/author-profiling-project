The staff and management were unfailingly friendly and helpful -- from the valets, to the front desk to the management. They even opened the breakfast room early to accomodate our schedule. Everything was very clean and seemed new. There is a bit of room for improvement in the timing of the room cleaning, which was sometimes rather late in the day. Yes, the pool is small, but our pre-teens enjoyed it none-the-less. We also appreciated the self-service washer and dryer ($1.25/load each) and free WiFi. The location felt safe and was convenient to the French Quarter and several good CBD restaurants (Mother's, Bon Ton, Cuvee all within a couple of blocks). Country Inn Suites far exceeded my expectations for a hotel at this price point.
