Our favorite time of the year is February, although we also love the ocean during the summer. We are very dissapointed at Wyndham's new administration of the resort. They have spent millions refurbishing and remodeling the casino and some areas at the hotel, but have spent little else at the resort. The golf courses are very badly kept compared with the previous administration. The tennis center, once renowned, receives no upkeep and the roads leading to it are filled with potholes. I heard Wyndham is planning on building over 800 time-share units at the resort. To do that, they will significantly alter and shorten the golf courses and will eliminate the entire tennis center! Management at the hotel and a 7th floor presentation of the Wyndham Vacation Club Ownership confirmed these plans to us. We were so dissapointed! The resort is not only loosing it's charm already, but it is on the way of practical extinction as we know it and towards a very unattractive concept. The food has not improved and is even pricier now. Parking is still scarce (has always been a problem) and also expensive. The ammenities in general are less than before while prices are not to par with offerings. Also, they are building huge beachfront projects that have already taken away most of the views to the ocean and the natural landscape is rapidly dissapearing. What a pity!
