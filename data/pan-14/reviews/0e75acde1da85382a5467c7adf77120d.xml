I had read a few bad reviews about this hotel before I went on holiday and I was expecting the worse but it was excellent. Nice welcoming reception, friendlyhelpful staff, clean, tidy room, powerful shower, good room facilities (hairdryer, t.v etc.) I would describe the room as a typical british travelodge room. nothing posh but standard. I would recommend any one staying here and I would feel confident returning to this hotel. It is also a great location - pretty central but not on a busy street and it is nice to walk outside the hotel straight onto a canal. We didn't have breakfast as we thought the price was pretty steep at 16 Euros and there were plenty of places around serving breakfast anyway.
