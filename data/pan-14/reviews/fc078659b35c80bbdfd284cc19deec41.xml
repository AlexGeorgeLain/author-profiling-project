Just returned from the most fabulous hotel experience EVER!We had a suite, consisting of, lounge with TV DVD player, another TV in a swish cabinet in the bedroom.a bathroom , with bath and shower,and a visitors cloakroom, mini bar in room electronic safe, more lights and switches than I could count including a floor level light, and a bay window with , yes, a view of the bay, and the hills and dozens of skyscrapers as well as the Victoria Park with all it's sporting activities. The toileteries were abundant and extensive, as was the breakfast menu. The roof top pool and jacuzzi were elegant and naturally spotless with all round views, although I can quite see that some rooms may have a restricted outlook. Just a couple of nights, but it seemed like Hollywood, in fact probably better from what I've seen of Hollywood!
