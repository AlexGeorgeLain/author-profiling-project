This was the first trip to Barcelona for my wife and I.We booked three nights stay at the Hotel Jazz which is perfectly located near the main area not far from the Ramblas.The hotel is clean,modern and has good facilities including a rooftop pool and solarium.There are also free toiletries in case you forget the essentials.Our room also had a mini bar which was useful for keeping our wine and drinks cool after a long day sightseeing!We found the free internet access useful for keeping in touch with home.The only thing lacking in our opinion was that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.If like us you prefer to eat breakfast outside the hotel I would suggest the Cafe De L'Opera on the Ramblas as a good option.Also a good tip is to go to El Cortes Ingles Department Store a short walk away,go to the Cafe on the top floor,get a window seat,order a coffee and admire the stunning views across the city. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.
