This is our second visit to Paris, and we based our choice of lodging on tripadvisor reader's recommendations. We were not disappointed. The location in the Rue Cler market area was superb...we visited the bakery next door to the hotel which was fabulous, and ate crepes from Ulysses restaurant on Rue Cler...try the trois fromage!The Relais Bosquet is a great little boutique hotel...quite modest, but very charming. It is clean, and offers several amenities you would expect in a larger operation. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful (even in translating a french website on the lobby computer). The reservation was very easy and everything was just as presented on their website.We did not eat at the hotel so I can not comment on this.I wholly recommend a stay at the Relais Bosquet if you are visiting Paris...you won't be disappointed. We will definitely consider this hotel our own little home when returning!
