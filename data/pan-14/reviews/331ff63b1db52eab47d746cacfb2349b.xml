The building is an old elegant building with a lot of original character but with modern furnishings. Reception staff were very helpful and gave us maps and other useful information on tours and attractions. We wern't disappointed with the rooms either, dark wooden flooring, neutral decor, modern furnishings. The room was lovely, and very clean, beds were comfortable. We were lucky to have a room over the main street with french opening doors and a small balcony. Bathroom was nice with a good shower.Location was a big plus just a five min walk to las rambas and many places to eat and drink. Central location to all major sights and designer shopping!! Hotel is a 2min walk to le courte englais which is a large department store, which outside you can get the airport bus to the airport for 4.10 euros which takes about 35 mins, the buses come every 5mins.I would recommend this hotel, it was fantastic.
