Was a bit nervous as I was arranging the trip for myself and a French friend who might be critical but we were both delighted. The hotel is near to the Metro and to RER station Haussman-Lazare from Gare du Nord Magenta. We had large quiet room number 11 on first floor at rear of hotel, no view but lovely large bathroom with lots of character. Rooms spotless and towels changed every day. Dining room is small but pretty and lots to eat but you can have breakfast in your room at no extra cost, this is customary in Paris hotels apparently. The staff were friendly, my friend's French no doubt helped, she said that few of the staff were actually French although I couldn't tell from the accent.We had a super meal at les Deux Theatres restaurant, set menu with lots of choices for33 Euros inclusive of a bottle of wine between two and coffee plus a sparkling wine aperitif.The hotel is handy for the sights with a combination of metro and walking. We found that a Paris Museum Pass was handy to skip the queues at Musee d'Orsay and Louvre but didn't save money unless you are a museumaholic. Would definitely return to this hotel.
