We found it good value for money and it has a bit of old world fading grandeur about it which is attractive in the splendid lobby but less welcome in the smallish slightly worn rooms and tiny bathroom. The minibar was poorly stocked (or maybe not to our taste). Inroom internet charges are ludicrously high--why do hotels charge for a service which costs them so little? But service was good, always friendly and the two concierges, Eva and Cleatter (yes that's how it was spelt; it's a Creole family name)were superbly helpful. Rooms were made up after lunch, too late in our view and there is no turn-down service or refreshing of towels. If you want your sheets changed you have to leave a card requesting it--with the usual 'spiel' that they're trying to be green: maybe, but it feels like they are trying to be cheap. Everyone raves about New Orleans cooking; we found it good if rich but a bit 'samey' in the well known spots. The Hunt Room in the Monteleone provides competent cooking in the genre. There are more atmospheric places. And if your head isn't spinning before a cocktail in the Carousel Bar it certainly will be afterwards, if only because your seat revolves around the bartender, but it's a popular spot and a bit of fun in this Grande Dame of a hotel. Overall we'd recommend and go back.
