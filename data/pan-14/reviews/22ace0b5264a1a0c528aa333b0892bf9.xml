The people at the front desk could not have been more hospitable in booking tours, restaurant recommendations, mapping out the city, immediatelly printing out train schedules, arranging for taxis, etc. The hotel is in walking distance to most Madrid sights and the Metro station. It is situated in the old part of Madrid (that is where you want to be) a few minutes walk to Plaza Mayor, Puerto del Sol and the Royal Palace. Our room was clean, quiet, air conditioner worked wonderfully (major plus), free mini bar, Swiss chocolates delivered to your room on your first night. We reserved our room through a travel agent and had breakfast included. The breakfast was wonderful, one of the best breakfast displays I've seen in Europe (and we travel extensively). So, overall for the price and location this is the hotel to stay at when visiting Madrid. We had a wonderful time and will certainly return on our next visit to Madrid.

Also, if you have a car (as we did), you can get in and out of Paris in no time. The hotel room was perfect, we had a double deluxe, with plenty of closet space and just very comfortable overall. Hotel staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay memorable. Breakfast was a bit pricey, but you can go to the Pastry shop just a couple of stores down. We shall return on our next trip to Paris.
