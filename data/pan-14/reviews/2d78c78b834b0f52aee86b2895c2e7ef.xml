The rooms are comfortable although compact and the location is excellent. It's worth requesting a front room as it's glorious to wake up to the Pantheon right outside the window. People watching is great value with the Sorbonne being so close.The staff are unfailingly helpful and courteous and although we didn't have breakfast there once on our first visit, we took it there almost every morning of our second visit. It was a lot cheaper and more substantial than in a cafe and the waitress was wonderful. There are plenty of good local restaurants within easy strolling distance and the Musee de Moyen Age is close by and well worth a visit to see the beautiful Lady and the Unicorn Tapestries. We will be happy to go back again on our next visit to Paris.
