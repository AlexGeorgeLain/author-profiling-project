We had four very comfortable nights at the Adagio (Nov.9-13 '05). We received a warm welcome from the friendly staff, and were shown to an attractive, clean, spacious room (#404). The bathroom was large, and adequate, nothing fancy, with plenty of room for toilet kits. The high point was the bed! It was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in my life. And it helped to have a lovely down duvet, too. The hotel location is a few blocks from Union Square, which was perfect for us. The one downer was that it got a little noisy sometimes at night, as the windows were open and the bar scene is a little rowdy. I think we'll always stay at this hotel when we're in San Francisco.
