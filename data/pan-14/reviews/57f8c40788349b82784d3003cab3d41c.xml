Our friends were in Room 124 which was at the front and slightly noisy if you are a light sleeper whilst our room (126) was to the back of the hotel and therefore was not at all noisy. Both were spacious, clean and very comfortable. There are also double doors to the rooms which is an excellent security feature.Breakfast was great - cereals, yoghurts, various breads, cheese, cold meats, smoked salmon, pate, jams, etc. as well as hot food such as sausages, eggs beans. There was also a good selection of juices, teas and coffees.We have stayed previously at The Savoy, Continental, Excelsior hotels which are all within a few yards of the National but will definitely stay here again on our next visit.
