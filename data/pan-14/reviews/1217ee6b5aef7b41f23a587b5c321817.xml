From the time we were met at the airport and escorted VIP style to the Airport Lounge and then to our car and finally to the Hotel, we found the service perfect. The Club Lounge is a peaceful air-conditioned oasis in the heat of the Bali sun. Every single one of the Butlers was extremely helpful, polite and and always knew our names. Nothing was too much for them. I am disabled, and they even insisted on filling my plate from the buffet after I had chosen the food and placing it on my table. Not just Yoga, but all the Butlers were very hepful, pleasant and charming, as were the managers of the Club.The food in the Club Lounge was not Cordon Bleu but baring in mind the heat, we could only eat small portions. Also the fact that you received breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, canapes, cocktails and supper we thought the extra we paid was very good value.We too had noise from the renovation works, but we learnt to ignore it.We would go back to the InterConti Bali tomorrow if we could. All the guests we spoke to, said the same. It is a lovely hotel and the management is superb.
