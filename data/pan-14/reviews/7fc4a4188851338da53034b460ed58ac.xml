The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds, tv with films payable on departure, loads of storage space, nice bathroom with great water pressure although the shower is down quite low, not very comfortable for tall people. The rooms were cleaned each day with the beds made and towels changed. It is situated extremely close to the Universtate stop on the metro line and this links you with the rest of the city. We got the bus from the airport but had to guess where to get off as the bus driver was no help, we got a taxi to the airport from the hotel and it was 20 euro which saved us alot of hassle. Don't forget your beach wear when your going to Barcelona as there is a great beach. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as it seems like a rip off as there are so many cafes around the hotel with much cheaper breakfast menus. I would definitely stay in the Caledonian if I was going back to Barcelona.

I checked out many, many hotels on the internet before making a booking and was glad I did my homework. It's central to absolutely everything, the rooms are lovely and the staff are friendly. Ask for room number one, it's huge and has two chandelers and its on the ground floor so there are no steep stairs to negotiate after a few drinks. If your going to Amsterdam you should definitely stay here.
