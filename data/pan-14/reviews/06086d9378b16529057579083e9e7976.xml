The hotel matched the Orbitz price that we found online. The hotel was very clean. The breakfast was adequate (muffins, toast, bananas, apples, juice, coffee and tea). The walls are thin as stated in an ealier review, That could be a problem. One night we slept with the radio tuned in to classical music station. We asked for extra pillows right away as they were quite thin.My daughter (in her 30's) and I stayed there for a girls' trip to San Francisco for five nights. We were only at the hotel to sleep and did not expect it to be a five star hotel. So it worked out just fine. It was an easy walk to Powell Street ,which is on the main cable line. On arriving from the airport we took the BART in to Union Square (rather than a cab), the Powell station, for $5.15 a piece. That was a bargain! Now, we did have to walk and drag our luggage quite a few blocks up Powell Street and across Sutter Street. But we knew we would have other things to spend our money on. The hotel is only blocks from Dottie's True Blue Cafe, an easy walk for a wonderful treat for breakfast. Our wait was only 30 minutes. Not bad! A Walgreen's is at the corner of Powell and Sutter. That was a convenient location!One night we enjoyed a Cosmo in the adjoining Plush Room before retiring to our room.All in all, staying at the York Hotel added to our fun vacation to San Francisco!
