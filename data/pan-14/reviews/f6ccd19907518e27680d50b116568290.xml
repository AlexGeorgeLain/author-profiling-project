So like in every dorm, we had these problems: - WC shower were not so clean (but enough to use them!) - you're woken up by your roommates during night Good: - hotel is really safe - staff is friendly - nice bar inside (with a terrace)- not too noisy - very good location Bad:- it was really hot in the dorm (even with the fans) - roommates who switch on the light when you're asleep- the shower's light which you can't switch offIt was nice staying at this hotel, I recommend it for people who stay a short time in Amsterdam to visit or to party
