It started out a bit rocky when we were offered a room with 2 beds overlooking the intersection of Ala Wai Seaside. Not wanting to spend the next morning sorting out our room, we said we'd wait while they found us something else. After 5 or 10 minutes, we were given a room on the 36th floor, with a view of Diamondhead/golf course/mountains/bit of ocean. Since we'd made the reservation many months in advance, it only seemed reasonable to wait for what we'd reserved. We knew from reading reviews at this website that the bathroom kitchen areas would be small, so no surprise there. The room was made up daily, and kept in good shape. The balcony was large (unlike the first room we were offered) and was used daily for morning coffee, and to gear down in the evening. It was a short walk to restaurants, tours, beach, and shopping. Thanks to a previous review, we found St. Germaine bakery (Kuhio accross from Jack In The Box) the first night, and had great bread every day for breakfast. Since we were staying for 2 weeks, the coin-op laundry was appreciated, and it was no hardship to wait at the pool while it was being done. There is also a massage center right on the same level as the pool, laundry, and sundries shop. Overall, we'd consider staying there again.
