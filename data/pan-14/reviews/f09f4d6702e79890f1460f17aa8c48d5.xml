Old and imposing with long balconies which frame the facade. Inside it's a different story. The rooms are modern and sleek. The bathrooms simple but functional and the staff are lovely. This is a great little hotel in a secluded part of sydney. There is no hustle and bustle but all of that can be reached by a 10 minute ferry which drops you right in the centre of town. Also the ride over is the best $5 boat tour of sydney harbour, taking you past the opera house and the harbour bridge. fantastic hotel and very rasonable rooms (we stayed in the small but functional rear rooms). There was no A/C but they said the better rooms all had A/C. (shame I was being cheap)
