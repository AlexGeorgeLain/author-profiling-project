After reading all of the accolades for the Library Hotel, my husband I were curious to see whether we would agree....and we do! We enjoyed the complimentary wine cheese in the afternoon. Again, we wondered, if complimentary would it still be good? The wine, cheese, other snacks offered were of good quality replenished often. We thought that this was such a nice thing for the hotel to provide for its guests. On the 14th floor is the bar area where an outside patio area is located. Although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable and quiet. There were only 4 rooms on our floor we never heard any noise from the other rooms. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were a pleasure to deal with, they were welcoming attentive. We already know that when we are in NYC again, we will stay at the Library Hotel.
