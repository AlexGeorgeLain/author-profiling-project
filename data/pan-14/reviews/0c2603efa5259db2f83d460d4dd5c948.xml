Arriving at 9pm following a drinks party I was told there was no record of my reservation. I looked at my printout and realised I had booked for January by mistake!Front desk managed to find me the last room in hotel, very impressed. Lovely meal in the Roux Brasserie (have the salmon followed by skirt of beef)
