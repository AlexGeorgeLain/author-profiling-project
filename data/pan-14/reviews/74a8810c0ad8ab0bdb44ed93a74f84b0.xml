Residence Inn at Times Square was the perfect location - we could walk everywhere we wanted to go except Chinatown/Soho and the Waterfront. We were glad to be a few blocks away from theTimes Square chaos, and our rooms were very quiet, with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building! Our hotel offered a great breakfast every morning, and we were impressed by how spacious and comfortable the dining/public rooms were. During our five-night stay our concierge was a real font of information - we relied on him for all our dinner recommendations and reservations - made finding a great place to eat an easy adventure. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, and the rooms were very clean and comfortable - it was obvious the property was quite new and very well run. One of our most memorable ventures was going to the Top of the Rock our first night there - what a view and no line! And don't miss the Carnegie Deli (north of Times Square) for a great experience - not only the best, funniest, most welcoming waitstaff and star-studded clientele, but the BIGGEST reuben sandwiches we've ever tasted! One tip - the hotel does not offer any in-house transport, but Yellow Cab is limited to a $45 max. fare to anywhere in Manhattan, including JFK. Trips to Laguardia are not under any regulation, but our fare only added up to $25 (including tip), so we definitely recommend flying into LGA over JFK if you're staying at the Residence Inn at Times Square. DON'T use any limo services - we made that mistake when we arrived and ended up getting charged $80 (plus tip) for our transport to the hotel. Stick with the Yellow Cabs! Thanks Residence Inn for a great base for our adventure - we'll be back!
