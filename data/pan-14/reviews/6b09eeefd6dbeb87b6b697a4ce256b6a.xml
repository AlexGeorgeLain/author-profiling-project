The room was cosy and clean due to this room was renovated room.Location was great. Most convenient location. Shopping centre is located acoss the street and thre are so many restaurants around the hotel.Also very close to City Hall MRT station (around 2 mins walk) and close to Bugis Street as well.Concierge was courteous and friendly.If you are staying in this hotel, ask for renovated room.You'll not regret your stay when you stay in renovated room.I'll recommend this hotel to someone who is staying for short time due to room size is small .
