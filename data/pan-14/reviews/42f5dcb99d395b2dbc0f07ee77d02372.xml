My friend and I shared a partial ocean view room and it was plenty big enough for the both of us single girls..ha ha . I am taking my mother and kids there again this year as it is right across the road from shopping and Waikiki beach, and directly above Macys and the International Market Place. Dont bother looking any further , this hotel is clean,friendly, on the main street, across from beach/shopping and has the best prices for its position. I go to Oahu from Australia every year and will not bother to look at any other hotel for whether im travelling with friends or with my children the BeachComber is Clean,Convenient and Prime Position. 5 Stars for me
