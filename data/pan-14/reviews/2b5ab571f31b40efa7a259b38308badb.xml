I was in this hotel this winter (at the beginning of January) with my girlfriend ant it was a great experience.The hotel is very near to some of the most popular places of Berlin and with bus (the bus stop is more or less 50 mt far from the hotel) we were able to reach easily Brandenburg Tor and Reichstag.The hotel was very confortable even if the rooms were very small. However we found everything we needed to spend few nights in Berlin.Moreover rooms were very clean and the towels were changed everyday.People at the reception were very kind and they could easily help us.We found an interesting special offer on the hotel website and if so the hotel can be quite cheap.Because of rooms dimensions maybe this is not the right hotel to stay in Berlin for one month but for a week it's great.It is a good starting point to visit Berlin.
