No chairs were in the room, just too very comfortable beds. Lots of stains in the hall carpeting, and hall had a strange baby powder smell. Difficult to find parking and entrance to hotel. The Westin charges you for there wireless internet. The bottled water was $5.00. You can go next door to Harrahs and get free beverages. For the price you pay for these rooms you would think that internet would be free. We tried to check out on using the television and it would not work. Room was clean, and we did feel safe there, but not happy with all the extra charges. Found staff very friendly!
