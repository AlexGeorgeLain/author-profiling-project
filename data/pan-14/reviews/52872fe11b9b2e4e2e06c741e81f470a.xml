The hotel has a club-like atmosphere with very friendly and professional staff. Each member of this staff was always ready to do whatever they could to make our stay more comfortable and enjoyable, from front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff. However, and this is very important to us, they were never intrusive, a quality we sometimes find unappealing at a bed and breakfast. Guests should know that the hotel has added the service of hot panini sandwiches, available on a 24-hour basis, which demonstrates the concern the hotel has that nothing contributing to guest convenience has been overlooked.After our first experience over Christmas at this hotel, we have already booked in for the same time next year. The two-room suite with beautiful Bay view is a perfect place to enjoy a home-like holiday.
