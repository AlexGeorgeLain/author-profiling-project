My company complained that at $300+ SGD per night, it's a bit expensive, but it is Tokyo!I love the location of this hotel. It's in the trendiest part of Tokyo, sitting right on top of the world's busiest pedestrian crossing, and more importantly near a pivotal railway station.The hotel room is quite small (maybe not by Tokyo standards) but it is very very comfortable, with a nice bath and a techno toilet. The selection of beverages in the minibar is very wide - one night I had no idea what I was drinking.The best part is the Japanese breakfast. I have never had another breakfast like it, and it has modified my food habits. As a bonus, it's served at the top of the hotel, so there's an excellent view to be had of Tokyo central.I am looking forward to my next trip to Tokyo, and I will definitely be staying here.
