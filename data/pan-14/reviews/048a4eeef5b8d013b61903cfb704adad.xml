The hotel was beautiful, and the wedding we saw out of our windows were extremely romantic ( just in case anyone is looking for a hotel for their ceremony .) The beach and the four pools was really great, and the service was excellent. Large clean rooms with a very large, luxurious bathroom. I loved the little bus that takes you around the territory so you do not feel too bad if you get a room further from the large, main pool and the beach. The other four pools were also great and reachable from every room on the territory. Overall, highly recommended.
