The hotel is very modern, very clean, and not too far away from the city center. And the location is quite possibly the only drawback, if you think a ten minute ride by bus to city center is unthinkable. We didn't have a problem with it and the bus stop is only about half a block down from the hotel. You can even buy bus tickets from the front desk of the hotel. If you would like to take the taxi, from the train station (Sta. Maria Novella) it's about a 15 euro trip going to the hotel and for some reason a 20 euro trip going back to the train station (I think we were hustled out of that return trip) which is supposedly dependent on the number of people and number of luggage that is transported. The shower is clean and immaculate. The beds are very nice and comfortable. I stayed in a twin room with my brother which was a little smaller than the double room my parents stayed in next door. The size of the twin room was still fine. You get a nice flat-panel tv, air-conditioning after a long day of sightseeing, and a nice breakfast with eggs (and bacon if you wake up early enough). I saw both Trafalgar and Globus tours staying at the hotel during our four days. Great price for a swanky, modern hotel in Firenze!
