The prices are totally ok, and the rooms are spacious and have amazing bathrooms!Although in the vicinity of the railwaystation the Hotel is really quiet and beautiful.The hotel just has a special little something that makes your stay so pleasant!The staff is very attentive and friendly. All in all a perfect stay I was there shortly before Christmas 2006. It was a great trip!If I go to Florence again i will definately go again to the Da Vinci!

The hotel is directly on a subway-station and taxis take 5mins to get you to Alexanderplatz.Nice Hotel also to discover Kreuzberg or Prenzlau as these areas are relatively close by. I stayed there one night. It's clean its ok maybe nothing totally special but clean friendly and tidy and thats what matters.
