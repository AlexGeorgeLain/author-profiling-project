Paid per night for a rear facing room, reasonably quiet during the daylight hours, but after midnight my room number109, which was 1st.Floor, was directly above the bottle bank ,paper for recycling and other rubbish collection boxes. Around midnight the bottles from the day's sales were thrown into the collection point. Around 1.a.m.they were collected by a team of noisy workers who made even more noise than when the bottles were deposited. At two a.m. another lorry turned up, turned the waste paper bin upside down and crashed everything into the lorry. By this time I had become so annoyed and wide awake that it was after 4 a.m. before I went to sleep, to be woken again at 9 a.m by a lorry dragging a very large skip container along the street immediately below my window. where it was left to be used by workers in the building opposite, who filled it with mountains of rubbish by 11 a.m, making more noise than ever. This was my worst ever experience of hotels in fifty five years of travel throughout the world. I would not stay at Hotel Preciados ever again if I was offered a free week as compensation in response to my written complaint to the hotel made as I left this morning.
