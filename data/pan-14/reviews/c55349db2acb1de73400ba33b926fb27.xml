First impressions where the very steep stairs up to the reception on the first floor. Easy check in with John very friendly. Then we where informed of the bad news our room was on the fourth Floor...yes again that meant walking up them dreadful stairs. The room looked clean and well presented on the first look...but look deeper...The room was very small...enough room to walk around the bed though. The sheets looked clean, as they where white..Bathroom was very very small, but we managed to cope for the 4 days. On the 2nd day, I started get these red lumps (very itchy) turns out there was bed bugs!!! Yuck. I am covered and so is my boyfriend. That put me off immediately. Plus one evening we where walking about in our bare feet and my fella screamed, and there was a rusty nail sticking up out of the floor. The location of the hotel is excellent. It took less than a minute to walk to the main square of Leidesplein and about 15minutes walk to Dam Sqaure.The hotel would be fine for those wishing to make alot of use of the local coffeeshops, but for those wishing to have a nice weekend away, stay in a nicer hotel.
