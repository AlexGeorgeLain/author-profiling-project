With a convenient Union Square location, you are really within walking distance of all the great points of the city. Besides being a few block from the BART station and Union Square shopping, it's really just an easy walk to the theater district, Chinatown, Jackson Square, Financial District, and a beautiful walk around Nobb Hill. To get to Fisherman's Wharf, it's just a $7 cab ride.Now back to Hotel Rex itself...what a gem. The rooms are quiet (except on Saturday night...I think the college kids at the nearby Art Academy were partying at some club) and decorated with a comfy, funky flair. But the best part about staying here is the friendly, efficient, and extremely helpful staff at the front desk. And what a neat surprise to eat a lovely breakfast in the connecting restaurant, Cafe Andrea. With the jazz/french music and the library theme...it's a joyful way to start your day. Also most helpful is the computer room next door where you can print your boarding pass lickety split.
