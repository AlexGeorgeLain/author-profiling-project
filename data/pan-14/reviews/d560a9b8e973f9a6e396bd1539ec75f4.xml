Gorgeous large rooms, helpful staff, comfortable beds, and very clean and safe. The walk to the Pavilion was 10-15 minutes at most. Across the street is a small cafe where you can get french toast, bacon and coffee for only 4.00! Hardest part was driving into the city to the hotel, but that's not the hotel's fault!
