The booking experience was pleasant through the website and got the best rate I could find - cheaper than asiarooms.com and asiatravel.com. You will get an answer to your query within 4 hours, no matter what time you send it. We got a free upgrade too when we got there!We got there late at night and was very impressed by the room and the service. The staff are kind enough to hail a cab and give instructions in the local language and are helpful with anything you may need. I had some tiny trouble with my internet connection at the room but they solved it right away. The lobby, main reception area and rooms are very tastefully modern - nothing tacky in this place, not even the huge green wall at the foyer. The corner room we got [2108] was lovely and had more than enough space for us. The bed was just one of the most comfy I've slept in in a long while. They are a bit short though, for a girl who is 5'10 and a boy who is 6'4 - his feet were hanging off the bed. We like a pretty basic breakfast and we got what we needed at the hotel buffet - it was perfect considering we really went to town with dining in HK. With all of that it's a great location. Luxury shops like Chanel and LV are just around the corner, the MRT is nearby on foot and there's a tiny bar that serves Hoogaarden on tap, ten steps away! Everything just melts away when you're inside Lanson. It's quiet, peaceful and beyond lovely. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Hong Kong.
