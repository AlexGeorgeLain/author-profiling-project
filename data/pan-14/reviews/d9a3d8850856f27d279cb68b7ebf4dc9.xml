My husband and I have just spent 4 weeks at this very pleasant hotel, returning to the U.K. on 16th December 2008. The hotel was fine, perhaps a little tired. The beach, weather, hotel staff and service! We have no complaints.We had a lovely holiday, all in all. We also met some lovely people, ciao! Antonio e Salvatore, We have read some reviews on this hotel and we wonder if we have been to the same hotel some other people have reviewed. We found the staff at this hotel to be excellent. The food in the main buffet was also very good. We have visited virtually every island in the Caribbean and found this island and this hotel comparable to any other.
