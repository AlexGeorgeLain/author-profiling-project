Try it as all of the rooms are similar and they can't stick you in an inferior room just because you are a Priceline Customer, a practice I have encountered at other properties.With that said, this is a great choice for families visiting SF. Fisherman's Wharf is the place to stay for family tourist. Note, not for couples on a romantic getaway or for business, but for family tourist and the Argonaut is a great choice for that segment. Mom and Dad will like the decor, the evening complimentary wine tasting and the Kimpton Hotel chains attention to the little details that make a place better than the rest. Kids will like being at ground zero for all the tourist activity that swirls around this section of the city, Pier 39, the cruise to Alcatraz, Ghiradelli Square and the endless T-Shirt and sunglass stores your 12 to 18 year old set loves (plus lots of their peers to mix with).I have no complaints other than to echo the high price of Valet parking but after a 400 mile day on the road, I wasn't up for anything other than handing it over to the valet knowing I was about to take a forty dollar a day beating. The only other thing i can mention, and this is minor but so weird I've got to mention, is that most of the room doors open out into the hall (think about it) and when people let them shut, they make a noise enough to wake the dead (I qualify as such after a night on the town!).
