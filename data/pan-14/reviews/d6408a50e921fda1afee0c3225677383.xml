We spent five nights in the Honeymoon Suite. We have no complaints about the accommodations. Our room was very nice and clean.There is good for here, but you have to seach for it. The buffet is good for breakfast and lunch. I hghly recommend making reservations at one of the restaurants for your dinners. If you only eat at the buffet, you will not enjoy your stay.This is a mega resort. It is very spread out. You will have to take a tram to get to many places. This can be a nuisance at times. Please keep in mind that not many of the suites have an ocean view. Our suite was literally about a mile from the beach.If you are one of those ugly Americans, you may not like this place. Please remember that you are in a third world country where Spanish is the national language. If you have no patience for repeating yourself or for not being understood, don't come here. The servers and bartenders speak very little English. When in Rome do as the Romans, try to speak Spanish they really appreciate the effort.Unfortunately, this resort allows timeshare representatives on the premises. Be prepared, you will be approached by them on a daily basis. Do not fall for the free gift offer, unless you want to waste a half a day listening to their sales pitch.Remember, you get what you pay for. If you don't expect the best, you will enjoy your stay. If you expect the best, you will be very disappointed.
