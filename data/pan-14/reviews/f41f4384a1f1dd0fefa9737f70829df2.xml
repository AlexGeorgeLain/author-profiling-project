We wanted to stay on Waikiki for one night pre-cruise and chose the Outrigger because I happened to find a great deal ($200 per night) on their website one day, which I never saw again.We opted for a standard city view room. Upon check-in I (barely) mentioned wanting something on the quiet side of the hotel (after reading previous reviews here) and was given a partial ocean view room with no hesitation at no extra charge. The room was clean, modern and tastefully decorated. I really felt like I was in Hawaii upon entering.We felt the service was great and even my 11 year old commented on how good it was.We enjoyed eating lunch at Duke's right on the beach. I found was surprisingly inexpensive for a hotel restaurant. The location was great. It's right across the street from the International Marketplace and right in the middle of all the shopping and restaurants you could ever want. I commented to my family about how Vegas-like it was there.The only negative I could come up with would be the pool. If you are traveling with small children be forewarned. The depth starts at over four feet and graduates to eight feet with no really shallow place for little ones. They will definitely enjoy the beach more than hanging out on the small stair landing.
