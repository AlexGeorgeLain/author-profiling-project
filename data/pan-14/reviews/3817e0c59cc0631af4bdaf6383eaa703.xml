If you are looking for good food, a nice pool and great people, this place is for you. If you're looking for the blue-green color and rolling waves of a tropical ocean this is not your place. There is a natural reef in out in the ocean which acts as a breakwater, knocking down the waves. That being said, the resort itself was wonderful. The staff was awesome, whether you wanted to sit by the pool or join in on the games or dance lessons. The beach party on Thursday night was a nice touch up until it rained. (Buffet on the beach and a movie on the beach afterward.) The food was also very good, but could have a slightly larger selection. The grounds were immaculate and the drinks free flowing. The movie every night was great for kids (Pirates of the Carribean, The Lion King, etc.). Do not believe the dress codes on the website! You only have to wear long pants in DaMario's. Shorts and T-shirts allowed everywhere else. For the money it was very nice, but my next trip will probably be back to the Gala Resort in Play Del Carmen Mexico.
