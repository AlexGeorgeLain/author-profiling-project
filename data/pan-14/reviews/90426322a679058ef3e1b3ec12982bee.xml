October 5 nights.Got the Sheraton on Priceline and went with a certain amount of trepidation having seen the variety of reports.What did we find?A wonderful hotel with wonderful staff, a wonderful breakfast, in a wonderful location. We loved it!We were warmly greeted by Will on reception with the words I've got a nice suite for you on the 16th floor North Tower overlooking the Charles River. Oh yes! - I'll believe it when I see it!.And see it we did, exactly as described. I've lived in flats smaller than the room. King size bed in alcove and large chest of drawers, desk and 3 piece suite with coffee table. Two windows taking up virtually all the exterior wall with a view down to the river and to the Fenway on the left. Nice size bathroom in good condition. Even a small room off the main room with a work surface to house just an ice bucket and the coffee machine.No safe but used the very effecient safety deposit box system in the lobby.Hotel linked to the Prudential Centre so plenty of shops and eating places. Also T stop without going outside.We ate from the buffet breakfast each morning which filled us up until the evening. Staff friendly and helpful especially Sophia.We adopted her!Location is great with trolley tour stop right outside.It could not have been better in anyway at all. Would stay again at the drop of a hat.
