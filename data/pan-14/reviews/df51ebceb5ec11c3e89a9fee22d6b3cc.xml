Recently returned from a 7 nights stay at this hotel, and would like to recommend it to anyone wanting a hotel right in the middle of Hollywood. Travelling with 2 kids (8 11) we were looking for somewhere clean, safe and in a good location for the sight seeing we wanted to do, the hotel was perfect. Our room (9th floor, overlooking Highland) had views of downtown LA on clear days and the Hollywood sign to the north, was large even for the 4 of us, with ceiling to floor window. The bathroom was pretty small (but didn't spend too much time in there!) and was immaculately clean. Turn down service on return after our first hard dayof sight seeing was a perfect touch. Didn't try the buffet breakfast as a little pricey for the whole family. Instead went to Johnny Rockets which was right next door in the shopping complex, which the kids loved! Fantastic location to wonder round and do a bit of shopping after dark and still feel safe. Always something going on outside Graumans theatre, wether it was street entertainers or Captain Jack Sparrow lookalikes(who was charming!). Disney took us about an hour in rush hour to get to, 15 mins to Universal, 30 mins to Venice/SantaMonica. Valet parking was 24 dollars perday, so better off using self park(same place) with the max charge of 10 dollars per day! Couldn't fault this hotel, would definately stay again.
