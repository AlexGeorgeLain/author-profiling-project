We were in the Regency Club with is complimentary buffet breakfast and evening cocktails (well worth the small extra cost)The staff are the friendliest, but equally efficient, one could wish for. They quickly learn your name and greet you wherever they see you.The gardens are superb. It would be easy to spend a day enjoying all the flora and fauna.Yes, the buildings are concrete and it wasn't built in the last 5 years, so if you are looking for a plastic modern hotel, go somewhere else. But if you want to be in Bali, for me it is here.This is in my top ten favourite hotels in the world
