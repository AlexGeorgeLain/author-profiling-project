The decor of the hotel and the room was hip and elegant. We had a deluxe room on the 6th floor. Although there were only 2 twin beds, we pushed them together and it was perfectly fine. The room and bathroom were nicely appointed and very clean. The views of the street and the courtyard behind the building were charming. The staff, without fail, was lovely, helpful and patient with our feeble attempts to speak French (their English was, of course, perfect so we had no communication problems). It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and under a 10 minute walk to the Champs d' Elise. The metro was just a few minutes away. Excellent pastry shop right on the corner. While the neighborhood wasn't the most charming in the city, it was still very nice and everything we needed and wanted to see was readily available. Heartily recommend this hotel. We hope to return someday!
