Unfortunately the conference participants staying in the hotel were not informed of this fact. The weather was in the 80's during the day and our room was 85+ at night. A few fans were given out but the only window in our suite faced the busy street on the ground floor and had no screen. We requested a room change but were told none were available. Repeated complaints to the front desk resulted in several free meals at the restaurant- which actually was very good and, oddly, airconditioned unlike the rooms. Nothing was done about the room temperature or the screens or the fan which fell out of the open window.A month after our stay there was an expose on Good Morning America of the cleaning practices at this hotel. They showed cleaning staff wiping floors with used towels and then using the same towels to clean drinking glasses. It wasn't that surprising after our stay.

We had a suite and adjoing room for the night of New Year's Eve, did not know that there would be a huge party which would shut down all public spaces for hotel guests-no access to bar, restaurant, lobby or pool. Our rooms were at the end of the building with the fire escape right outside. Party goers clattered up and down all night keeping everyone awake. The best part came at 6AM when we were getting ready for the Rose Bowl Parade and found that we had no hot water in any bathroom. Later we discovered there was no hot water in the hotel at all. The hotel is interesting, but only a fool would go back.
