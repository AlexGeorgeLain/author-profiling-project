I traveled to Amsterdam last week with 2 friends from the US and originally booked a big apartment to rent. Once we got there we determined that our apartment was too expensive, given how week the US dollar is. We walked around and our last stop was the Nova. I'm so glad we found this place. We got a triple for 90 euros w/ breakfast and couldn't have been happier. The room was nicely decorated, spacious and the beds were comfortable. We were in room 224 and had a beautiful view of the street. The breakfast was ok, nothing to brag about but served its purpose. The hotel has a lift, so to the other reviews regarding the stairs, I'm not quite sure what that's about. The staff was very helpful as well. Great bargain!!
