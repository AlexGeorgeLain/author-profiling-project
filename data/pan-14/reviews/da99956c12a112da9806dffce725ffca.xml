The staff are warm and extremely helpful, guiding us to excellent area restaurants that were not too touristy, and helping set up a mini-van tour to Giverney, where the flowers were in full bloom ( a side trip well worth taking during the spring). Our room, while expensive, was worth the money. It was spacious by European standards, exceptionally well maintained and clean, and very comfortable. In the evenings, small groups gathered to listen to live jazz in the bar. Free internet connection is also available. The area is terrific, in every direction there's everything you could ask for - museums, cafes, shopping, markets, Ile de la Cite, the Louvre, the Seine, Jardin du Luxembourg, just to name a few. We can't wait to return to Paris and stay at this exceptional hotel.
