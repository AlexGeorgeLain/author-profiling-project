This is simply one of the best hotels available in Amsterdam for its price range.My girlfriend and I stayed for 2 nights in Amsterdam at hotel Nadia and after hearing nothing but horror stories about the accommodation from friends who have travelled there before we did a lot of research and decided to stay in this hotel and it was a good choice.From the moment we arrived, the staff where as helpful as possible and carried all our bags up to our room and got us sorted out with maps and information.We stayed on the top floor in a lovely room with a private balcony overlooking 2 streets and a canal. The room was clean, comfortable and decorated in a lovely traditional manner.At night the room was quiet and breakfast the following morning was excellent.The hotel is easy walking distance from the main train station and the dam is a quick stroll away so the cities nightlife is only a few minutes away.We will defiantly stay here again.
