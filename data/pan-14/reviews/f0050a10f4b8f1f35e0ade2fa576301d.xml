I picked it because the reviews were so great, and I really loved it. You can't beat the location, and the parking set-up worked well for us, since we had a car with us. We left it in the garage most of the time and used the cable car in front of the hotel. Mostly we walked.The room was very small, as was the bathroom, but it was so clean, cute, and neat that we were fine with it. We had been warned through Tripadvisor reviews that the rooms were small. Best of all was the service! Everyone was just real friendly and very helpful. We had a blast!Highly recommend Beach Blanket Babylon if you can get tickets.
