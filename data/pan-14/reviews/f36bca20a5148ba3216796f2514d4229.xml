We loved it! We were given a tenth floor room facing the ocean. We were thoroughly entertained watching the activity on the beach when we were not actually there ourselves. The hotel was immaculately clean, the personnel were very friendly and helpful, and the food in the restaurant was excellent. There is a tour desk in the lobby for booking activities outside the hotel. The hotel itself provides a full day of planned activities if you are looking for something to do. Our travel agent found a special weekend rate for senior citizens that was a wonderful deal. This is not just a hotel for senior citizens. Indeed, we were in the distinct minority with many young couples and family groups too. The Condado area is the resort spot of San Juan, and this hotel is located right in the middle of the area with a gorgeous beach. I wish we could have stayed longer.
