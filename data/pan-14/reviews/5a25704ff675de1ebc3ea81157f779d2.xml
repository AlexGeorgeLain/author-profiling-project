It is situated within a short walk of Zoo Bahnhof, near shopping and dining areas. The room was very spacious, comfortable and quiet. I found the duvet too heavy (being used to colder climates) and when I asked for a lighter one it was produced immediately. The service was friendly as well as efficient and a huge plus for the hotel is its Michelin Star restaurant, 44, where I had both lunch and dinner and is a place that should not be missed. Overall, a great experience.
