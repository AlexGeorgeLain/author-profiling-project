My boyfriend and I decided to go to nyc during the busiest time of the year, for new years and wanted to be in the middle of everything...so time square was perfect and so was hotel 41! staff was super friendly, and the room was not perfect but good enough. i read reviews beforehand of how small the rooms were, and trust me they are not lying...however for 2 people it is fine, and you are so busy sightseeing that trsut me your room is good enough to sleep in. whatever hotel 41 lacks in square footage they make up in location. you are located in the heart of it all, and next to 3 subway stations. however dont expect a view, because you have a huge building right in front of you, even though pick it! you will enjoy it!
