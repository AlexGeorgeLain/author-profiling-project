Cleaning was perfect, and concierge offered good service for us, booking our restaurants etc.Hotel is located perfectly, just a 100 meters from Times Square, and a walk away from everything...Really recommend a visit to Nobu restaurant and Buddha Bar Restaurant. Both places offers great food and a fantastic atmosphere.
