Very busy hotel, several banquets, etc. The hotel has two parking options, valet for $20, with unlimited in/out priveleges, and free self parking, in a garage, 50 yard walk from the entrance. Staff was excellent, from the valet, bellman, to check in, very smooth; waitstaff at dinner and breakfast was very professional. Hotel has five dining choices for dinner: room service, a steakhouse, sports bar, southwestern restaurant, and a 24 cafe. All seemed to be good choices. My room was on 13th floor, had view of runway, and balcony. Flat screen TV, and Granite and Marble shower were very nice. The bed was excellent as well. I think I was in a suite but for some reason I think all the rooms are large after the renovation. Breakfast buffet is better than average. $15 per person, but well worth it. Fitness center is open 24/7, but leaves much to be desired. At least it was free. Internet is $10 per day. Pictures on hotel's website are accurate. Nice Place, very convenient if using the airport. Probably to much of a hassle for anything outside of the airport complex.
