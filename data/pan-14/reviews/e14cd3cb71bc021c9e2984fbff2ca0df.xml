We were a family of three, mother and two teenager daughters, first time visitors to Italy, speaking no Italian. Hotel Colomba was a good pick. The room was clean and comfortable, and the location was great. Went to the market, the academia galleria, duomo, and many other sites, all within easy walking distance. Staff was not especially wonderful with us, and did not allow us to eat breakfast early on the morning we were off to the Duomo. However, this small, unpretentious hotel was a great find. A computer with internet hookup is available free of charge for guests, which my daughters especially appreciated.
