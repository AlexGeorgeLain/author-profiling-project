I attended a conference there, and was busy with it most of my visit, so I did not leave the hotel during the three days. Check in was okay, no real problems, but staff is not overly accomodating. Very dry, no smiles, just like robots, not rude, but not friendly either. I was sharing a room with 3 other adults, and we were quite cramped. Beds are doubles, not queens, so it is small for two adults. Hotel is huge, with lots of restaurants, shops, nice atrium, etc. Our meals were catered by hotel, and all were done very nicely. Food was presented well, was delicious, and service was good. I did not eat in the restaurants outside of catered events. It was very expensive. If you stay here and want to enjoy the amenities of the hotel, bring your good comfortable walking shoes. It is a hike from one area to another. Overall, it was okay for the convention, but I would not choose to stay here otherwise, on my own. Business center is available, but very expensive to use. This hotel caters to large events and conventions, and does a great job at it.
