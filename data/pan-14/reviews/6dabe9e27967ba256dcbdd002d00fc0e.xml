We had been staying in a fourth floor walk-up apartment in Florence with our two grandchildren, and our granddaughter who has juvenile diabetes, went into insulin shock early one morning. We had no phone, no one to contact, and we speak very little Italian. We did get an ambulance summoned, she was taken to hospital, and was stabilized. I knew we would not go back to the isolation of the apartment, so my husband and grandson went knocking on doors to find a hotel nearby. They found the Hotel Colomba which was close to the hospital and we spent one night there before continuing on to Venice. The hotel was perfect. Very clean, large rooms, many ammenities not usually found in European hotels. Rosanna and her husband were very understanding of our situation and made us feel very secure and assured us we could call on them if another emergency arose. ( It didn't and our granddaughter had fully recovered by the next morning). The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, as was the cappacino. The location is perfect too--close to everything. If we ever return to Florence, we will certainly stay there, and we have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so. It is a excellent family hotel.
