The rooms were of average quality but with come intermittent plumbing issues during our say (apparently some heavy rainfalls had overloaded the system). The property overall was well laid-out and large enough that you could get away from the bar or the beach depending on your mood. The food was average, The Paris restaurant was excellent, and the buffet was good too but I found the Italian restaurant to be sub-par. The pasta sauce tasted exactly the same at the tomato soup appetizer. The beach was great, with lots of waves and white sand and the pool was clean and the kids tended to stick to one end. I had no problem with the language barriers and the staff were pleasent enough. The disco was a great evening out though after the third night there the music began to repeat itself quite a bit. If you don't like Latin music or Rap/Reggae, you won't like the disco. Overall, the best parts would be the beach and the property in general, while the food could use a little work.Also, they say don't tip the bartender, but if you want prompt service and premium brands then you might want to find a regular bartender and slip him a couple of dollars every few days.
