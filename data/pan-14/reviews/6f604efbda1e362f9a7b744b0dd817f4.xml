Similarly, there were no pangs of 'how much do we tip?' when the bellboy unloaded our bags in our room. I should point out that myself and my wife aren't tight....just shy.The room was as billed...great quality, nice exposed brick and headache inducing carpets all round....I loved it.Downsides: We had a 'quiet' interior room that faced onto a void in the middle of the hotel...hardly inspiring in a city with so much to see...I would have paid extra to have a view...any view.The bathroom was small and I wasn't impressed by the rather sorry shower curtain...in a hotel of this standard, I'd have expected glass...The adjoining restaurant is seafood based, so if you're a fishetarian like myself, best look elsewhere for your tucker. (Breakfasts at the restaurant / diner directly opposite the hotel entrance were superb)Minor irritations for what turned out to be a great 3 night stay.San Francisco was well worth the 23 year wait...highly recommended.
