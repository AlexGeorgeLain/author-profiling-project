We have to come to San Francisco for sign installations at local schools, and this hotel serves our needs very well. It's convenient to the freeway and gets us in SF fairly quickly. The staff is very nice. The rooms are comfortable, and Houlihan's is convenient for breakfast and when we have worked all day and don't feel like searching for parking on Geary, it's great to sink into a booth there and have a salad or hamburger. We tried the Holiday Inn Express a couple of blocks away this trip, and moved after two nights to the Holiday Inn.
