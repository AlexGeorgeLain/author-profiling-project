I paid which compared to what you can get for that elsewhere in London was a bargain. Funky, clean, gorgeous soft sheets, comfy bed, amazing bathroom and free water! Check in and out was fine, all staff were very friendly and full of information about the hotel. Had a cocktail in the bar which had a great atmosphere and was full of saturday night revellers. Didn't eat in the Grille as the breakfast bag was sufficient, but looked nice. The only problem we had was that the room was very hot so we didn't sleep as well as we should have in the very comfy bed. In the morning we found the air conditioning controls - doh! I will definitely be staying here again, and i will be refreshing their booking page endlessly when the and room offers are next on!
