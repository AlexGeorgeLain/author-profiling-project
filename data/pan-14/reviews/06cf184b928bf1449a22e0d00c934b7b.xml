Couldnt fault it at all, even with the hurricane going on the 2nd week we had great time.The entertainment team during the day were excellent,made everybody enjoy the games and made them forget the rain.Hotel room was nice and clean, towels cleaned daily and mini bar topped up.On our arrival, it was a long bumpy journey but was fine, we were given a lovely cold drink and cold clothes to wipe ourselves with as we were all very hot, this was a lovely welcome.Food was excellent, we ate in the buffet for 10 of the nights and couldnt fault it at all, ate in the steak house and chinese too, both these were lovely as well.Entertainment in the evenings was fine, repeats itself the 2nd week but they do a good job considering what they have.All staff very pleasant. Would definately return, and hope its very soon.Go and enjoy it, Im sure you will.
