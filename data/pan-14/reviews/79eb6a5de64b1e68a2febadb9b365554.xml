Nice exterior, very trendy. Location was really handy. We booked an Executive room, which was lucky, because that wasn't huge. But it was fine. Bathrooms were nice, shower was delicious. We like the stereo being the in the room. Bit dissapointing to open our hotel window and be overlooking cooling vents and airconditioners and nothing else. No lift, so you have to clamber up the stairs but that's okay. No room service, but there is a fantastic place just through the other side of the road called Morgans. Really nice. Mini-bar was super-dooper expensive, even by hotel standards.I would stay there again, but would try to find a cheaper rate than $189 pn for exec room, as that was probably overpriced and we could've got a fancier hotel for just slightly more money if we'd booked on Wotif. Again, can't fault the location.Recommend, but know what you're getting.
