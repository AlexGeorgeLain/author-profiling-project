I loved coming into my room and having music play in the room speakers. The hotel is located in Polanco which is a very nice upscale neighborhood in Mexico City. Breakfast in the morning was very good, fruits were fresh the ambiance was nice. This was included in our room rate!I recommend this hotel to anybody that wants to stay in a non resort like hotel in walking distance to the many luxury shops in the area.
