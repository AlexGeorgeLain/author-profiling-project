The location is good and the addition of the new central shopping centre opposite is very handy. We had received a letter to say there was a rolling refurbishment going on but we were not aware of any noise from this. Both the rooms we had were spacious, clean andcomfortable and although a little tired it was not an issue. The staffwere very efficient and helpful. We had room service breakfast which was excellent and the same price as the restaurant downstairs so no need to shower, dress and rush down. As nothing gets going until mid morning it was nice to relax and ease ourselves in to the day.The location is so convenient for all that Clarke Quay has to offer for an evening out. We didn't feel the need to look elsewhere for restaurants as there is such a variety there. Taxis are very reasonable and availabe from outside the door. We went to the botanic gardens, orchard road, raffles, sentosa (by monorail) over both stays.All in all a good base at a very reasonable price and once the rooms are updated it will be even better.
