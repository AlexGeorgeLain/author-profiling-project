Like other reviewers this is the second Iberostar we have stayed at - last year at the Costa Dorada.Found weather and evening entertainment slightly better than the C.D., but the food was slightly better there. Anyone who finds fault with either of these hotels is just being picky.In fact we are thinking of booking for the new Iberostar in Cuba for next year, due to open in a couple of months.
