I really do not understand those (mostly US) complains about the size of the hotel! It is a typical Amsterdam hotel, where space, amazingly, IS limited and damn expensive (unlike North US). So there is either the choice of staying downtown for a good price, close to everything you can imagine (from Bulldog Bar to Red Light District, shopping and museums area) OR pay 500 a night and stay 20km further, close to airport, with a great view of the landing area. Mention the Receptionist you want a room with canal view. otherwise you might end up with 35 or 36 for example, that face the wall. But this is the dutch experience. Breakfast is very good, with a good choice of cheese, jams, hams, bacons, eggs, milk, coffee, tee and cereals. Bathrooms are indeed small (compared to home standards) but again, this is Netherlands and this is a normal sized bathroom (and I've seen enough of that country, considering that my spouse is dutch). Don't forget to pick up the discount tickets in front of the elevators for the museums. WiFi is included, normally is a paper in the room with the key (or ask the front desk).
