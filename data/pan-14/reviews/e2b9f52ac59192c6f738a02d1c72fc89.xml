Its location is perfect; the rooms are comfortable and super clean; and the staff is simply fantastic. It is undergoing some remodeling, but that did not interfere with the good-night sleep I had on both occasions. I could not hear the outside noise either. On the last night I was there, I had dinner at the hotel's restaurant. The waiters were courteous and helpful when asked for suggestions, the service impeccable, the dinner simply great. I now know this is the place to stay whenever I'm in Madrid.
