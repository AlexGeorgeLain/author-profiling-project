Staying in one of Seattle suburbs would require driving on I-5 freeway which is usually gridlock 24/7 and except for the Metro bus, Seattle's mass transit is non-existant. We were traveling with our 2 middle school grandchildren and Comfort Suites was the only moderately priced downtown hotel that offered two beds plus a hide-a-bed.The two rooms of the suite were so small that in the bedroom there was barely room enough to walk around the beds. Both the bedroom and living room had oversized entertainment center/closets which took up a large amount of space. Although the room was clean and the bathroom appeared to be fairly new, the carpets were extremely worn and stained and the furniture was stained and threadbare. The bedcovers looked like something from the 70s.The staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast room and breakfast was excellent. However, the nice couryard outside the breakfast room is rather wasted because there are so few mornings in Seattle when it is warm enough to sit outside and eat.The $149 price was reasonable enough, but when you add on the 15.8% Seattle motel and sales tax it probably would have been more advantageous to stay outside the downtown area.This hotel is just not up to Comfort Suites usual standards.
