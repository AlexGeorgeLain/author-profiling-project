I booked this hotel through Alpharooms.com after reading reviews on this site which all sounded quite good but after staying at this place I would not recommend this hotel to anyone with any kind of disabliity such as lymphoma, arthritus or heart trouble. The stairs were extremely steep and narrow and with no lift I was unable to get my case onto the second floor, fortunately I had help from another guest as no help was forthcoming from the staff. The room was very small and old fashioned with no safe or tea making facilities I couldn't wait to escape it! The shower was good but with no where to hang the shower head it was impossible to shower under. the door got stuck as soon as it was shut and it was hard to get out! The breakfast was a waste of time as we spent ages waiting for cups, knives etc no hot bacon and eggs or fresh croissants. I do not think that this hotel was very good value and will not be going back there .
