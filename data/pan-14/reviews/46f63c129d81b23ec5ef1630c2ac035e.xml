When I first stayed there, there was no phone book in the room and no suit case valet.This time I had three situations of the staff lying to me. First, on the cost of valet parking. Secondly, when asked why my car was not moved from the 30 minute zone after 5 hours, and thirdly my request to get a hotel information package up to my room. With all my problems, I was anxious to fill out a survey form, but after two weeks of staying there....still no form. They told me a follow-up form would be coming by e-mail. The staff just don't care. And this comes from the Management attitude.
