The hotel was very modern and a nice enviroment, the staff were very friendly. The room was really nice and modern I loved staying in this hotel. The ony downside was the noise as the bar downstairs gets really busy and the music doesnt stop till the early hours. All in all it was a lovely hotel nice staff nice place to eat but very noisy after a long day shopping!
