The bathroom was small, with a tiny shower. We are average sized people and if one of you sits on the toilet, your elbow touches the glass of the shower stall. When you are in the shower, you have to turn off the water between shampooing your hair and soaping your body, because there is no room to move, to get out of the spray of the shower while in the glass enclosure. The pool area could use a little upkeep and landscape work, but the pool itself was clean. All that being said, the front desk people were extremely nice and eager to please. Breakfast was pretty good with a selection of hot and cold items to choose from. The hotel is well located. 2 blocks from the train station and about 1 mile from the Accademie and Uffizi Gallery. There is a good, moderately priced pizza/pasta restaurant almost across the street from the hotel. The hotel's own restaurant was ok, but kind of high priced for the type of restaurant it is.

It really is a dream. Very charming, clean and the staff is top notch! We especially love the little breakfast with the jam filled croissants that are to die for, served by the cutest little old woman. We stayed in room # 5 with a private balcony overlooking one of the small canals. It was very relaxing sitting on the balcony on a quiet evening listening to the city settling in for the night. We will be back again as soon as possible!
