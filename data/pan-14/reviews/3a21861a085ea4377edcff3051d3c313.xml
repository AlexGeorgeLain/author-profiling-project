Suite had excellent wardrobe/cupboard space, good lighting, very comfortable large Queensize bed and superb bathroom with bath and separate shower with water jets. Really outstanding buffet breakfast for which you pay extra but well worth it. Location in Montmartre just right-lots of little shops/bars/restaurants close by with bus and metro stops short walk.Staff could not be more helpful and spoke excellent English. Would definitely stay again.
