I arrived at the San Juan Beach hotel 8/31/07 and was given a lagoon view smoking room. (I had requested a ocean view non-smoking) I contacted the front desk and was immediately swapped into the proper room. The walls and floor was damp, but being fair it seems almost impossible that they wouldn't be because of the fact that they are between the bay and the ocean. The floors were dirty...no excuse for that...there hasn't been a vaccuum in room 703 in quite some time (maybe months) so the sand just sticks to your clean feet. The bathroom wasn't swept the entire time we were there...I know this because I actually circuled (in pencil) the large dirt pieces on the floor to see if the maid would notice (She did not). The windows were filthy! There was no excuse for how dirty the windows were because having an ocean view it would be nice to see the ocean! My husband attempted to raise the window and the glass and frame literally came out of the track and fell into his hands. (Luckily he got it back in track and left it be.) The elevators are slow, but they get the job done. We had free continental breakfast everyday, expect for the day that someone took the key home with them and there was no breakfast. (I didn't ask what key, I was afraid I didn't want to know.) If you aren't expecting anything grand then you'll be fine...but I do prefer clean accomodations. I honestly feel that with a better housekeeping staff this hotel would be okay. Sure the hotel could use a bit of time from the local handy man...but the main problem is the dirt. I guess I'd rather stay in a clean motel 6 than to stay in a dirty 4 star hotel.
