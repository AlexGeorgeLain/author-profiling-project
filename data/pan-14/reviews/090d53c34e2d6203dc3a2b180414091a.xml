My wife and I were looking for a good deal at a smaller hotel so we pulled up TA and, at the time, the Magda was #1 or #2 and it had a number of glowing reviews. We took other travelers' advice and it was exactly what we expected. Yohann (and the others at the front desk) was extremely helpful and made some outstanding recommendations for dinners and nightlife. If you are like us and would rather spend more money on actiivties and great meals than you would on the hotel, but still need a clean, safe place to sleep, this hotel is perfect.
