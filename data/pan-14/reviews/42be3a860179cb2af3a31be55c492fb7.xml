We used our platinum benefits and were given a BEAUTIFUL suite overlooking Copley Square.The staff are great,loved the Oak Room bar and dining room(for breakfast) but nothing is cheap especially when you are Canadian.The lobby is gorgeous especially with festive decorations, speedy elevators, a very effective front desk staff...all made for a wonderful stay.We returned for 1 night Jan 1st, all was good except our deluxe room had NO view, could be depressing
