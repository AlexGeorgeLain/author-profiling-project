We were unsure if we were paying for the hotel or the location to the walk of fame, hollywood bowl, etc. We were suprised to find a hotel that had great staff and great admentities. The room was excellent with a soft, comfortable bed and large flat screen TV. Overall, we were happy we stayed on this property and would glady do so again.
