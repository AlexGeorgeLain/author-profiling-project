We stayed there from Aug 17 to 24th.Flight: Excellent - Flew with Air Canada and the flights were prefectArrival, departure and transportation to and from resort: Excellent- took us less than 1 from the time we arrived until we checked into our room. It was prefect. Departure was prefect as well.Beach of the best we have ever been to.Pool: Good - Large but not inspiring.Facilities: Good maintainedFood: Good selection is amazing but everything else is average.Staff: Average - Hardworking but not friendly.Room: Poor - specious but poorly decorated. Sink was leaking, closet handles broken and furnishing is wobbly. The opening between the room and the bathroom is not a good idea when you have kids.
