I stayed in a Pyrmont room that looks over the Pyrmont Bridge (opposite to Darling Harbour side) View was not spectacular. On arrival my electronic key did not originally waork but this was quickly rectified by pleasant staff. The furnishing were nice but nothing special. TV has a great selection of channels but was an old 51cm tv which is very substandard when you pay $270 a night and other hotels charge less with LCD screens avaiable. Fantastic place to stay for the nightlife as the casino never shuts and there is always activity in the area especially on a weekend. Istay at Star City more for the fact that it is right on top of a great casino and good restaraunts not for the quality of rooms although i have never stayed in a bedroom appartment and these may be different.
