We got a room (295) in the renovated section and liked the style and amenities. They have integrated the bathroom and closet, in a functional way. The room felt spacious and in addition to the queen (?) size bed a desk/chair and one sitting chair. Lots of useable shlf spaces in the room. The tv was small. The room did face Budapester Strasse, still the noise was OK, even when we opened the window.The checkout was ok - except for a discussion over a charge for a pay for movie we did not watch and the hotel waived the charge. We did hang out for 20 min in the lobby and it is large, I'd like it to be a bit more cozy.Regarding the booking: we used hotwire to book and then found out rooms in Swissotel (highter rated in tripadvisor) were available for the same rate.
