Stayed for 4 nites at this property and initial thoughts going in was that this is going to be a dump. Once I checked in, I started having some good vibes. The front desk staff was friendly and accomodating the entire time I was there. The rooms have been recently renovated but they were a little small. There is a small bar on premise and it isn't cheap either. A premium vodka and tonic set me back $8.00 Kinda high considering the bar isn't anything fantastic and this wasn't even a super premium vodka. The breakfast buffett wasn't bad and I enjoyed that. Didn't try room service or ate at any other times in the restaurant. One of the things I did enjoy was free parking and it was quick getting from your car to your room. I'm so used to having to pay daily parking garage fees. The room probably had about 30 or so cable channels so that wasn't bad. Another positive is the close proximity to uptown, victory park, west end, love field, etc.. Although the immediate surrounding is kinda dumpy, it doesn't take long to get anywhere.
