The room was small but modern and very clean. Everything worked! The staff worked extra hard to provide us a dairy free breakfast. They helped us with a minor medical problem as well. The rate was extremely reasonable in this very popular city. I wish they had special arrangements for parking as the covered parking garage nearly was quite expensive.
