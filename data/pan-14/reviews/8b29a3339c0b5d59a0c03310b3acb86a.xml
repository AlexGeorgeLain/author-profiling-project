The main buses all pass by the Wyland and stop just outside.The staff are super friendly and efficient and unless you want to spend a lot of time in your hotel, or want a beachfront property, the Wyland has all you need. The bar is nice and the barstaff really friendly.When we stayed, the restaurant wasn't open yet, so breakfast was just a muffin/bagel/pastry and a coffee or tea - not ideal, but it means you can eat breakfast on the beach or elsewhere if you like. And I think the restaurant is opening soon. Once it has, this will be an even better hotel.
