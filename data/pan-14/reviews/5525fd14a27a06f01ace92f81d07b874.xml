The room was amazing! I felt like royalty! They had complimentary breakfast in the morning, and they said it was continental breakfast so we thought it was going to be a basket of muffins, but there was a huge spread, they had eggs and meats and cheeses, breads and cereal, pretty much everything you could want. We really felt like we were valued, the concierge took extra time with us to show us around and make sure we'd have everything we needed. It was amazing.
