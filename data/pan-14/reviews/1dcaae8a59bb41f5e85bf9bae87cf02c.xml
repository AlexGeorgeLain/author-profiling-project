Do Not Expect Tequila on check in!Firstly, be aware if you book with Orbitz and hate your hotel, you are stuck. We were greated with a obviously stressed Tony, although we were the only ones in the lobby. Our room was promised after 3pm. At 3335, we were told there was a problem with a backed up toilet in the room. Not a good start. We were told that was the only room available (possibly because we were prepaid as Tony told us over and over, so beware of how you book, you may get a lesser room because you are stuck and they know it). We asked if they could find us another hotel and we were rudely informed by Tony that he would hold our reservation until we found another room but they wouldn't help us find another hotel. Again, Tony reminded us that we were prepaid. In other words, we were stuck. Room was great, double pained windows, quiet. Clean, clean, clean. Offered tequila on checkout, not by Tony. Would have been perfect exept for check in.
