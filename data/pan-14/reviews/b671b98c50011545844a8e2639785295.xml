The position is very central and convenient. The room was quite compact, but I believe that is not uncommon in the area, a little short on drawer space, but it was very clean and the room service was good. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful. The most impressive part is the first floor (second to the colonials) lounge area with a very good drive yourself 24 hour espresso machine, a good continental breakfast and an excellent cheese and wine session in the early evening, factor all this in and the price is excellent. A very pleasant stay
