Make sure you call and confirm the shuttle. This can take a while as the hotel is about 15 minutes away, and on the return trip make sure the schedule the time as they have planned times not on demand shuttles. When we arrived with the hotel supposedly sold out, but the front desk was friendly and we got a room. Probably a back up room as it had ground floor view of a maintenance area, but none the less the room was comfortable although the air conditioner had been left at 58 degrees - cold. Breakfast area was crowded but had the standard warm and cold breakfast options. Overall a good value for a layover.
