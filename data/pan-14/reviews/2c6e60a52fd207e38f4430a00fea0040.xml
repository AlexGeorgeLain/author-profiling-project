We requested, and received, a 20th floor room facing Central Park. The rooms are neat, and the kitchenettes are a great benefit. We went to the Fairway Market to buy breakfast essentials, but actually there is a market further up Broadway about 2 blocks that is a little better in our opinion. Close to the 72nd street subway and in a wonderful area, the Beacon is a great hotel.We will stay there again on our next trip to NYC.
