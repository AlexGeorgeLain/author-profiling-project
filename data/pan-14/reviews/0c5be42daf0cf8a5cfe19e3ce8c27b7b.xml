This is perfect spot to be staying in the hub of it all, yet down a traditional side street with plenty of atmosphere not the huge bussle of the ramblas. We had a super trip, climbing the stairs in gaudi cathedral a must some fantastic local tapas 3 course meal restaurants down little streets in the gothic quarter. You need to explore by foot to discover the best restaurants. We also went to a beach out the city which was well worth it for a day of relaxing in the sun called, sitges. Enjoy!!
