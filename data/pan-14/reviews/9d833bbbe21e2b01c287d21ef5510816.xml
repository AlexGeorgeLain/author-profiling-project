We arrived from Nassau the same time as hurricane rita so spent the first 2 days in our room. Wasnt too bad, a bit windy, went for a walk and decided it was as bad as March in England. The winds left quite a bit of rubbish on the beach which wasnt cleared up. So stayed by the pool. New hotel being built next door so was a bit noisy. Thought the room was ok. Lovely big windows and a good view of the sea one side and Biscayne Bay and the posh houses the other side. The stuff in the mini fridge is a bit expensive. Staff were not too friendly. The conscierge people were nice though. Not much to see or do nearby though. My kids are vegetarians and struggled big time with food. Ended up cooking soup and instant mash in the coffee makers. Great fun. Jump on a bus outside to Ocean Drive, its only $1.50 each and there is a night bus to come back on. Thought the hotel was fine for a short stay. Hubby liked the gym. Dont order room service just before they close because they cant be bothered. My burger was not cooked (raw and cold in the middle). Got a refund so wasnt too bad. Maids are a bit annoying though, if you want a lay in, they wait outside your door and talk noisily.
