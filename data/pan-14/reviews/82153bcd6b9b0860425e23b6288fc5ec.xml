We had a double suite, had two queen beds in one room, and twin beds in second bedroom. Two bathrooms, which was a very nice surprise. There were six of us staying for a week and it was PERFECT for us. With all the running around, the family room was nice to unwind before jetting out to dinner. The kitchen is small, but so what? Tons of takeout places in the neighborhood which we did a couple of nights b/c we were just too exhausted after taking in all the sites. Very close to Grand Central Terminal and bus routes take you anywhere! I highly recommend this place.
