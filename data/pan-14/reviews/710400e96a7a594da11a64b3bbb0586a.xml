Not a good decision. Finding the entrance to the hotel is a major challange after dark. It is a single locked door with no sign or light on a very dark street. No indication at all of the hotel location. I walked back and forth before discovering the entrance. Then it was through a dark courtyard to a tiny elevator up to the 3rd floor. Alone and after dark this did not make me feel good. The front desk was not friendly when I arrived as they seemed preoccupied with something else. My room (actually bedroom/sitting area) was quite large, but very dark and cavernous. The only bright welcoming spot was the new sink/shower area. The wc was in a closet like area off the sitting room and old and musty smelling. The cold tile floors on 2 levels that you could trip over in the dark made a trip to the bathroom at night a difficult feat. Breakfast was very nice and the staff was friendly at that time. However there are many hotels in great locations and patios with lovely views in Florence. I would never stay here again.
