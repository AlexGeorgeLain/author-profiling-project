The location of the Biltmore is excellent, being just across the road from Pershing Square and its metro station. This means that prime tourist sites, such as Hollywood and Universal Studios are only about 20 minutes away. This was important for us because we didn't have a car to travel around. As for the hotel itself, the exterior but particularly the interior of the lobby is impressive. It strikes you as a quality hotel as soon as you walk through the door. The large pictures on the wall are reminiscent of the closing scene in The Shining; the corridor leading to the health centre has many photographs of the hotel's history- I thought this was a nice touch.The room we had was a little on the small side, but was otherwise fine.The health centre is an excellent amenity, featuring a swimming pool (which closes at 8 pm, which is a little early I thought), and a fitness centre (which remains open 24 hours). We ordered room service our final night, which was promptly delivered and was delicious. It was probably the best room service I've experienced in fact.The only negative I experienced during my stay was the shower in my room, which ceased to work on our final morning in the hotel, which meant I had to use one in the health centre. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. I got a good deal on hotels.com, and for what I payed my stay was excellent. The staff were courteous throughout and the facilities excellent. If I were to re-visit LA I would consider staying at the Biltmore again.
