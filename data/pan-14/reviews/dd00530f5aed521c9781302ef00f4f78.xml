Our bathroom was huge for a hotel bathroom, with very modern touches. Spacious room with coffee, tea, and a tv. Nice balcony as well.The staff was terrific. They spoke english well and were very helpful...Ordering a taxi directly to the hotel lobby. YES CARS ARE ALLOWED!! The location is amazing! Close to La Ramblas, which is a very neat and safe spot. About a 15 mins walk to the beach.This was one of the best spots during our stay in Europe!
