Chose this hotel based on other reviews and location and got a great deal via otel.com (one of the links via check rates).Everyone at the Lenox was so friendly and helpful. The place is small enough and old enough to have the character that you just don't get from the big corporate chains. The rooms are traditionally furnished and OK space wise although our bathroom was a bit small. I believe the lobby, restaurants and other public areas have all been refurbished in the last year or two.We only ate breakfast at the hotel which was good and the location is perfect just a block away from Copley Sq. Would recommend the Lenox to anyone.
