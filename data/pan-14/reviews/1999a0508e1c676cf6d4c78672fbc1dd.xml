It shares Nob Hill with three other grand hotels and it holds its corner very well indeed. We were on the 3rd floor overlooking the courtyard which was excellent as its was peacefully quite. We requested a twin room which we got (with 2 queen size beds). The room was spotless and was cleaned meticulously every day. The bathroom was pristine and the beds were exceptionally confortable. Personally I cannot understand some of the less flattering reviews about this hotel, we have no complaints at all. The staff were friendly and helpful. The elevators worked well and the reception staff were both helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the glorious city of San Francisco
