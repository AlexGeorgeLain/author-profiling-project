The accommodations are beautiful, and they take great care to details . . . beautiful flower arrangements, candlight in the courtyard, flowers in the room, and a surprise gift in the room each night . . . I felt like I was staying in someone's home. The staff at the front desk were very accommodating and friendly. Jean, Verni, and the others were very helpful with making restaurant recommendations and reservations, calling for taxis and assisting with day-trip suggestions and plans. Jazz at night was entertaining, and the breakfast in the dining room was extremely relaxing and quite delicious. The hotel is in a perfect location on the left bank allowing for easy walking access to everything. If you want to stay on the left bank, this boutique hotel is quite a charmer.
