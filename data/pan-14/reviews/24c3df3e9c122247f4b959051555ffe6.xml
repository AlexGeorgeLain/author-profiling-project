I booked the Hotel Montecarlo because of the good reviews on TripAdvisor.com, and all I can say is, the hotel was FANTASTIC. We are a family of 4 and booked 2 adjoining rooms on the 5th floor, away from La Rambla. The hotel exceeded our expectations. Everything everybody says in the reviews is true -- large beautiful quiet rooms, wonderful comfortable Craftmatic-type beds, down comforters, great showers and jacuzzis, robes and slippers, chocolates on your pillow, free internet, and the most helpful, friendly staff. We did not opt to pay 9 euros for the breakfast, but instead ate breakfast at the cafe literally next door, Moka Cafe, for a cheaper price. There was a cash machine next door, too, and of course the location on La Rambla couldn't be beat. The hotel is rated 3 stars, which I find puzzling, since it seems at least a 4 star hotel to me. We thought Barcelona was fantastic, and we would stay at the Montecarlo again in a heartbeat.
