Having read some negative reviews on this site before we booked we were delighted we had ignored them. From the minute we arrived at Reception the staff were unfailingly welcoming and helpful. The room was an adequate size bearing in mind this was New York and the bathroom had recently been updated with a super large shower cubicle. Good quality toiletries were very welcome as we had travelled hand luggage only. Our window looked out at the Empire State Building which was illuminated at night. Breakfast of fresh fruit, yoghourt, cheese, muffins and various pastries plus toast set us up for the day and hot drinks available all day were a lovely bonus when we arrived back from a hard day sightseeing. We used to take it to our room and collapse on the bed. Free wireless access and two computers were a bonus. Great roof garden was lovely but the food was spoiled by having to be brought up from the restaurant on the ground floor on cold plates so food cold and all drinks including wine served in plastic glasses. The situation couldn't be better right in the middle of Manhattan with a subway station 50 yards away. Pizza place on the corner was great for a snack but was not impressed with Brendons across the road. Bryant Park on 42nd Street is a great place for a rest if in the neighbourhood. Tables, chairs, free newspapers,books and games of chess. With hand luggage it is easy to get to the hotel by air train/subway. We got there quicker than some other people who had taken a taxi.
