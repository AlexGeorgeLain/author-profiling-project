Despite a call ahead of time ( one day) and a confirmed reservation for a NONSMOKING room, when I arrived at midnight from a West coast afternoon flight, I was given a somewhat nicely decorated room. But the stench from the smoke!!! Arghhh!I marched downstairs, with reservation in hand, and was told, Sorry, we have NO non-smoking rooms left As I am allergic to smoke, and can break out in asthma within an hour of being in a room like that I refuesed to stay there. As I was waiting for them to find something for me two other guests showed up, were assigned rooms, and also came marching down to complain of their non-smoking room reservation, and smoking room assignment. They both accepted a rate reduction and a promise to move the next day. As that was not an option for me, after an hour, they located a non-smoking room down the street at the Hilton Garden Inn ( a lesser hotel). Originally they were to 'walk me' for one night only, and I indicated that it was not possible for me to transfer during the day as I had business all day intl the late hours the next day. They agreed to let me stay at the HGI for two nights.MIND YOU THESE HOTELS WERE CHARGING $350/nite + NYC Taxes that brought it to nearly $400 a night. NO WAY JOSE
