The Hotel is showing it's age and is very basic, there is no lunch or dinner restaurant or even a bar! The room aircon was quite noisy as it is a bolt-on unit attached to the window. The TV didn't work initially and we had to get the repairman in. The staff were friendly enough but the Hotel was generally noisy, felt small and pokey. I could not reccomend this hotel. On the plus side the buffet breakfast was pretty good. We loved New York in spite of the uninspiring hotel though.
