The area is lively in general, but the hotel is on a small, quieter street. Overall, we were really satisfied with the hotel. Smart looking rooms and common areas, above average breakfast, efficient air conditioning (a must in Madrid!), free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel, and friendly and flexible staff made our stay very enjoyable. They even let us sneak in the breakfast room early on our day of departure, to get some fruit and youghurt before heading to the airport at dawn. The hotel advertises rooms with a street or patio view. We did not have the street view, so seeing the wall of the next building and neighbours' laundry hanging from windows must count as the patio view.We paid less than 130 euros / night (including tax) and with that price I would stay again at Room Mate Mario.
