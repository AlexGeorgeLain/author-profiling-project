At times it seemed as if there was one staff member per guest in the lobby - all ready to help with a nod of your head. Room quality excellent; bedding was very comfortable. Gym accessible via only a few elevators and relatively small (however rarely busy).Sleek, contemporary design in lobby area - amazing flower arrangements - ikebana - if you're interested in that sort of thing. Superb dining choices, particularly if you don't have time to leave the hotel. Excellent spot for business meetings. Small, limited selection of tourist shopping inside; just enough to satisfy someone there for a short stay. Right around the corner from the US Embassy and within walking distance to Roppongi. (That said, try NOT to make Roppongi your only stop should you be a first-time visitor to the city.)

The room accomodations were pleasant, but the decor was nothing spectacular. Staff was generally helpful and friendly.Traffic in front of the hotel, at least while I was there, was pure maddness. Thank goodness they had valet. Location was convenient, of course, along the main Waikiki strip. The hula show was interesting to see, although the same show was used every night (little variety).Friendly place for Japanese tourists as well; much of the signage, staff, etc. is bilingual.No gym (although I hear one is being built). While I was there they gave out free day passes to a 24-Hour Fitness down the street (not the most convenient).
