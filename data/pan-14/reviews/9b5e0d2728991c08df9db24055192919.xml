The hotel is new, of a good 3* superior standard and good value for money. Rooms are spotlessly clean, serviced to a high standard daily with plenty of space, a good double bed and excellent ensuit facilities. Staff are friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast option is well worth taking. No one seemed to eat dinner in the hotel - the restaurant one block south (facing Bacelona Nord Station) is good if you eat in the locality.Our recommendations for an excellent 3 day sightseeing break in Barcelona is to buy day passes (1,2 or 3) on the Metro and Bus Turistic. From the Hotel it is a 3 minute walk to the Napols Street entrance of the Arc de Triomf Metro station and then only 2 stops on the metro to Placa Catalunya from where you can walk the city or catch the Bus turistic. On return, look for the Napols exit when you get off the Metro as it is nearer to the hotel.Overall this Hotel is quiet, comfortable and good value. Barcelona is a wonderful city for a break.
