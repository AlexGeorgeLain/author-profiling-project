Yes it is basic, with the lingering smell of smoke ever present. The breakfast was nice and the room was cleaned on a daily basis. The view was beautiful and the location is great. Its very accessible, located not far from the city central, but further enough away from the red light district. The only fault I found with this hotel was that although a maid cleaned daily, there was a constant smell of urine coming from out of our bathroom and the room was never hoovered, only swepted, so you had some parts of the room very dusty. I would definitely stay her again, and prefered the location as many other hotels were too central and lacked privacy.
