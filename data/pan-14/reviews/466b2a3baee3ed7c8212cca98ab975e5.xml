We were weary at first but as we walked in Mindy, the front desk, greeted us with the warmest smile. Everyone from lisa to Housekeeping helped us, made us feel comfortable. Definitely will be back in a few months. The rooms are clean and spacious. Nice breakfast selection and Richard made sure we knew about cookies. Was like being home away from home--thank you!
