The jazz club is located in this hotel so we decided to stay there. We arrived around 1pm and our room was not ready but they held our luggage and we had lunch in the restaurant. The suite was on the 8th floor and was very well laid out and we enjoyed it. There is a separate bedroom and living/dining room and they are separated by the bathroom and fridge/microwave area. All the suites look out on to the center atrium area and it is a bit noisy but not enough to disturb your sleep. The jazz shows were excellent and we bought the dinner and show package for one of the shows and it was a good value. It was a 3 course meal with an excellent choice for dinner and then great seats for the show.
