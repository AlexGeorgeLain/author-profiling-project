Our room was very spacious - we had booked a standard room but I think we were probably given a larger than average room. There was a small lobby area to the room and the bathroom was perhaps the largest I've ever seen! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were fairly consistently excellent (with the exception of one waitress in the Star Lounge who hurried everything and was quite rude). The hotel decor is tasteful, and the relativley small lobby and reception area gives the hotel a personal feel that other five star hotels often lack. My only real complaint is the exorbitant cost of food and drink if you eat in the hotel - other than that, our stay was almost faultless.
