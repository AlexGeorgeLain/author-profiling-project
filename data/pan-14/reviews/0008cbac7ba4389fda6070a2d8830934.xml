The rooms were comfortable and well supplied with the usuals. We did feel the location of the hotel was a bit out of the center of HK. 30 - 40 minute walk or a 10 minute taxi ride. The hotel does provide a courtesy bus to various places in the center. Even if you did not use this the taxis are very cheap, only HKD 40.We booked this hotel through a travel agent and paid for 2 nights. I thought this was reasonable but do not know the cost of hotels closer to the center. The location is not a big problem because as mentioned the taxis are cheap to get about. I would reccommen people to stay here and would stay here again.
