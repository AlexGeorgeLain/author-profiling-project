Granted, it's beautiful...but so are a lot of other places. My biggest disappointment w. this hotel was the unhelpful concierge staff who had no suggestions nor were very courteous. Overall, I found the hotel staff to be overall pretty non-friendly and SLOW. The hotel is nice (sans the elevators) and the balconly views are spectacular...and I liked the beach bar very much...But I feel location, beach and hotel bars are pretty much on par as long as you stay in the same strip. And if you enjoy chain restaurants and a commercial setting, this is the place to be. Thus, I think it's a safe bet but I strongly suggest you rent a car and escape waikiki for the day and explore the island...There is so much more to be seen and enjoyed outside the commercial zone of Waikiki. And economically, ABC stores are on every corner; visit there before paying $20 for breakfast and $5 for a bottle of water. Aloha -
