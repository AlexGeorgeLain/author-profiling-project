Our rooms were next to each other on the 26th floor with great views of Manhattan and the Chrysler Building. Rooms were a good size with two large doubles and a a small sofa bed. Very quiet. Friendly and knowlegable reception staff and concierge. We didn't eat in the hotel. Breakfast was taken in one of the many local diners and we then ate whereever we happened to be. Fantastic location we were able to walk to most places and the subway which was very easy to use was round the corner. Free internet service in the business centre to book our return seats. Our travel agent booked our taxi service to JFK but the hotel was actually cheaper.
