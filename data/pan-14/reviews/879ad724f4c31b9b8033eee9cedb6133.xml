I found that almost every thing in this hotel was very nice with the only possible exception being the staff at the front desk. The rooms are nicely appointed, very clean and have wonderful views. the location is great as it sits with in walking distance of many major attractions and right next to numerous public transpiration lines. This is certainly not the cheapest option in Berlin but if you can get a slightly discounted rate as we did it is well worth the money.
