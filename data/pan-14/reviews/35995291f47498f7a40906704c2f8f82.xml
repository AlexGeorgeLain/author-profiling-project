Made reservations for us for Uffizi and AccademiaNice room with charm - old character.Good breakfast . We liked the free internet, free Skype calls, evening aperitif and appetizers in the garden - good opportunity to meet other guests.Hotel is just south of the river about a mile from Ponte Vecchio. 20 minute walk or 2 minute bus ride - bus stop outside the hotel -tickets at reception.All round a good experience.
