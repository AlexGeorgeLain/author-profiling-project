Reason why we chose this hotel was because this was the best value option going at the time and it certainly lived up to that! Hotel was spacious, clean and very modern - the sort of place thats designed for business travellers but appeals to everyone. Staff were polite, plenty of amenities, the only drawback for some would be the distance out from the main sights of Barcelona. Its a 10 minute metro ride into the city centre (and a 5-10 min walk to the station) but the metro is fairly cheap and efficient, so wasnt a problem. For nights out, a taxi from La Ramblas to the hotel around 2am not only took around 10 minutes, but was less than 10 Euros! The area around the hotel was fine. There is a large shopping centre almost opposite the hotel, which although generic, does have a few eating places and a large supermarket to stock up on daily needs. More interesting is the avenue beside the hotel, that leads directly to the beach (10-15 min walk) and has plenty of resturants along the way. Overall, I can pretty much guarantee you will not find a better option closer to the centre without paying a lot more money!
