This is perfect for either getting around town or checking out all the shoping malls on Orchard road (there are dozenzs of these). Lots of places to eat nearby, including the mandatory MacDonalds.Check in was very efficient and the rooms are of a good size and standard. Overall service was very good, but the view from the room wasn't up to much. There was a comprehensive buffet breakfast which kept me going for most of the day. Never tried the restaurant, but there was a very impressive display of fancy cakes that did temp me.Overall a very nice stay in a convienent location

They said there was a special offer at the Mandarin for about / night. About 20 minute taxi ride from the airport.Very nice looking hotel. 21 floors with the atrium going full heigth inside the building (as a builder always thought this was a bit of a waste of good construction space). Very good view from the 21 st floor looking down inside to the reception area.Didn't try too many of the hotel facilities as I was only there for 1 night. However, the service was good, the room was clean and tidy, and of a good size. Only draw back was that I was on the 6th floor, so the view outside was limited.Overall an excellent hotel for a reasonable price
