I didn't expect much knowing Ibis to be a chain for budget travelers; however, I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival. The staf was friendly and very quick. There were 3 restaurants and a buffet to choose from as well as a fully equipped bar. I was tired so I took a bath in a huge bathtub and than I ordered an hour of a full body massage!!! Pretty crazy for a budget hotel. Massage was great and it was done professionally in my room so I didn't even have to go anywhere. Food, dinner as well as breakfast, were tasty. There also was available internet and free airport shuttle. Over all, I was very happy with my stay at the Ibis and if i will ever have overnight layover I'll be sure to return!

Rooms are super clean and tastefully decorated. Gardens, gazebos, and lagoons are just amazing. You feel like you are in a fairy tale. Service is excellent! People are very nice and always there to help you. Drinks at the bar could be better - they all sort of taste the same. Food, however, was amazing - especially the buffet breakfast! I will definitely return to this hotel and I highly recommend it!!!!
