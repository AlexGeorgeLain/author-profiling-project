The hotel was listed as close to the airport, it is 10 minutes away. The room was bug infested, the a/c did not work, and the sheets on the bed were old and did not fit. We changed rooms and still were not satisfied. Plus there's lots of construction around the hotel.Cannot think of anything postive about the hotel except the price.
