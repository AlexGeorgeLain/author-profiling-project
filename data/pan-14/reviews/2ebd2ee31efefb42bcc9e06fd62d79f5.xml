It has traded on its location for too long and is not up to international standard. As mentioned by many others, rooms are too small to leave open a large suitcase as beds took up total space in room and very minimal cupboard space.Bathroom showing signs of deterioration around shower and toilet base. Internet very expensive; used it about four times for less than 15 mins each time and it cost nearly as much as fee for one month at home.Will choose another hotel next time.
