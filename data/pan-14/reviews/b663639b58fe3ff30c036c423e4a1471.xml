Stayed for 2 nights in Sept 08 while exploring what Amsterdam has to offer by day and night, hotel was really nice, clean and the staff exceptionally friendly....room was clean spacious with a kingsize bed and modern clean bathroom. Location is excellent for the museums and Vondel Park, there is a Tram (number 16) every 5 minutes from outside the hotel if u want to venture into the Dam square, Station area!! Warning though after sampling some of the local delicacies in the Dam area we lost track of time and missed the last Tram and a good 30 mins walk/stumble followed not what u need after trudging round museums all day!!
