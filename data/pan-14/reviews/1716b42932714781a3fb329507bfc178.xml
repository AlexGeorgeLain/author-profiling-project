We took the bus fom Charles de Gaulle, were dropped off by Arc de triomphe and was a 10 minute walk to the hotel (however on way back the hotel arranged an excellent mini bus to pick us up at the hotel, well worth the extra money). Close to metro stations, Champs Elysees, nice eating places on rue Marbeuf and 10 minute walk to Eiffel Tower.Stayed in a standard room, very clean, good shower and excellent l'occitane toiletries. We were on 5th floor and could see top of Eiffel tower. Bed was comfortable and hotel quiet. Only negative comment for room was the lighting could have been better. We ate breakfast in hotel once. Food was good but felt it expensive at 18 euro. If you go out of the hotel, turn right and go to end of the road there are a few cafes. The first one you come to on the left does a lovely breakfast for 6.5 euros. Would stay here again. On the last evening the hotel left a small gift on the bed with a hand written note from the manager - a very nice touch. On arrival home we received a nice e mail from the hotel.
