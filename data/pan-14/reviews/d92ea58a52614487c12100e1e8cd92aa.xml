We were offered an upgrade to a suite for for three nights which seemed reasonable.The suite was pleasant, L shaped with the bed rather squeezed into the small area.It was well appointed with good quality linens but it did need some updating. The bathroom was small but well equipped.Breakfast was an incredibly lavish if expensive affair with all tastes catered for - oriental ,continental or full English.The swimming pool and jaccuzi in the spa on the 17th floor were the piece de resistance. The setting was stunning with wonderful views overlooking the city.
