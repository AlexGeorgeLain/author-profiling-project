The rooms were smelly and the faucets in the bathroom were loose. There was Only 2 windows in the room which over looked the air conditioners on the roof. We requested a Port View, but I really don't think you could see the Port from any room. We had to pay $10 a day to park, which I think is crazy since we are paying to stay there anyway. We had a room for 5 people and only had enough towels and wash cloths for 4. When we called to get additional towels and wash cloths they brought us 2 of each. So we had to re-use towels the next morning for our shower. The front desk staff wasn't friendly at all. We stood there forever before they finally looked up at us to check us in. The Continental Breakfast was a joke. We had to pay $9.99 for each person to eat and what tipped it off they added a 15% Gratuity and they never touched anything. We got our on food and drinks we never were approached by anyone except to give us the bill. I wouldn't suggest this hotel for a long stay.
