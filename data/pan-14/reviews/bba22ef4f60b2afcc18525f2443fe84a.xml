Thankfully we read other reviews and were able to locate the hotel which is on the third floor of an apartment building. The room was lovely with a view of the rooftops and recently updated. The location was excellent just steps from the Duomo. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. What was very nice is that there was a laptop we could use in the public area. There also was a bar/breakfast area with a happy drink hour in the evenings. We met several repeat guests who described feeling like this was their second home. We would highly recommend this hotel.
