Booked a 6 night break at the Sofitel through their website after receiving my Sofitel privilege card, we chose this hotel mainly because of the great reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. Right from the start all of the staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you, especially Randy the Doorman, who would go out of his way to help you whenever he could.The room we had was a premier queen and whilst it the largest room in New York it was big enough, very well equipped and very well decorated. Also has a medium sized bathroom, which had a large shower, but a small and shallow bathtub.The hotel is ideally located for exploring the city whether you want shopping on 5th Avenue, Times Square or access to the subway system. I would highly recommend this hotel. If you are planning on staying here I suggest applying for a privilege card first as this gives you complimentary late check out and also 1 free drink per person from the bar.... Not to be sniffed at, at hotel bar prices!!
