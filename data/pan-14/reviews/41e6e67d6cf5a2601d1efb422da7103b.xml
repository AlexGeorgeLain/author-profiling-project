Due to last minute problems, the Eiffel-Seine arranged for us to be transferred to the Ares.The hotel is undergoing a major refurb and the rooms have been completed to the highest standards. They are surprisingly genourous for Paris City hotels. We had a big bathroom with huge walk in shower/double bowl sinks/reasonable sized bath and Versace tiles! The bedroom had Plasma screen TV and good range of both domestic and foreign channels. There are some reasobaly priced Bistos within 5 min walk, along with the Metro Station/Sarnie shop/Supermarket/Pizzeria and the Eiffel Tower is only 10 min walk away. At night you can see the tower illuminations from just to the front of the hotel.The only drawback is that there is still some work going on to finish reception and lounge and we were met each day with the fresh smell of paint or turpentine. But to be fair, it didn't interfere with our stay.The reception is managed by friendly multi lingal staff. Breakfast is available at an extra charge.
