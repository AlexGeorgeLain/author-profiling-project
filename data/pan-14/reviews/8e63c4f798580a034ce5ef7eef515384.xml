I requested a high level floor mainly to get an unobstructed view over other buildings. The apartment was $249 per night and was spacious and the view was truely special out to Sydney Heads and Eastern Suburbs. The apartments are large and had two bathrooms. The pool area is great with a spa and sauna area attached. Small things that need attention eg no pool towels, housekeeping always later in the day around 3ish, reception staff not overly friendly or interested in you (apart from swipping your credit card) means that I would rate it 4.5**. The location is fantastic and the monorail stop is right next door and there are shops and a Coles suprmarket underneath the building. I will return but definitely ask for a high level apartment as the view is amazing.
