I stay at many hotels but this one is absolutely my preferred one. Rooms are comfortable (suites even better...) view is fantastic.Service is willing and efficient. Breakfast is the best I ever experienced at any hotel. Staff make you feel at home.At one of my our stays my family had three suites. We ordered a complicated room service order (Japanese, Indian Chinese and Italian dishes). Everything arrived at the same time, in the right temperature and very tasty. Can't wait for the new New york, Paris London Shangri la hotels to open.
