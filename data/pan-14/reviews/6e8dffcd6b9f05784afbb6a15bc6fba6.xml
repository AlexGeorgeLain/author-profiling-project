This hotel was selected because of its location and price - close to the Duomo and not badly priced (about $300 per night for two). We weren't looking for a budget room as we wanted a lot of comfort and elegance on this blow the budget trip. We found the front desk staff to be very accomodating, especially the concierge who arranged many dinner reservations and outings for us. Breakfasts were fine, once we discovered we could order a cappuchino instead of the watery coffee served at the table. The bar was very welcoming, both bartenders made a very good martini, and we met so many interesting travelers there. The rooftop terrace afforded a fantastic view (and I mean fantastic) of the Duomo - what a great spot to bring up a bottle of wine and toast our trip and Firenze!
