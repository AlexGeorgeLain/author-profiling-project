This being my first visit to the area I was torn between staying in Fisherman's Wharf and staying in town. This hotel location was perfect for walking to the activities/restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf, riding the trolly cars to the Ferry Building and in walking distance to the cable-car turnaround. The hotel staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful. We found the restaurant to be great for a quick breakfast before a full day of activities. Our room was beautiful and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job keeping our room clean and stocked with all the necessary toiletries. The housekeeping staff even replaced the showerhead after our first day without us even having to request it. We thought the water pressure was just low in effort to save water---the new shower head proved our theory wrong. I would highly recomment this hotel and would definatley stay there again on a future trip.
