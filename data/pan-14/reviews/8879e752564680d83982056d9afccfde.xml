The first standard being that the guest comes first and no matter what, the guest is always right. This motto is ignored at the Mona Lisa. Instead, guests are blatantly insulted, publicly chastised, and treated as more of a nuisance. The grounds were pretty and the hotel was once nice (although now it is more faded glory). The breakfast was basic but nice, however, good luck getting the attention of the waiter to ask for tea or coffee. The most disappointing aspect of the hotel was the staff. Upon arrival, my friend and I were attempting to shut the old wooden door to our room. It was stuck and would not close, so we used some force and eventually it came. We went down stairs and were greeted by the woman at the front desk who informed us that if we were having trouble with our door we should come to her (ok that was the nice part) BECAUSE it was rude and obnoxious to slam the door and she added some nice BOOM BOOM BOOM sound effects to the end of her statement. She then proceeded to tell the bellman in Italian (little did she know I understood what she was saying) that we had slammed the door and were rude. It was all downhill from there. We walked up the stairs too loudly, were told that we were not allowed to have a picnic in the garden when we were just drinking bottled water, and our requests to have our drain in the shower fixed went unanswered. The hotel is located in a pretty grungy part of Florence...Beware unless you want to be treated like a child who did something wrong your entire stay!
