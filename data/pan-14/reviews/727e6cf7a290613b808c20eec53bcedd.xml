We asked for a higher floor and the move was taken care of giving us a lovely view of the Rockefeller building. If you're booking try and get breakfast included. It was just the start we needed to a day of exploring New York city. Use the concierge, they are very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The beds are VERY comfortable, just what we needed after a day of touring this fantastic city. The rooms are plenty big and the bathroom was lovely. Bottles of water left in room when bed was turned down was a nice touch. Free internet in the lobby proved handy for keeping in touch with friends and family, and finding out news from home. Able to adjust the room temperature using the room thermostat. (Handy in a heatwave!). Excellent location. Quick and easy access to 5th Avenue and Time Square, with Broadway a gentle stroll taking 10 minutes at most. Staff were all helpful, efficient and friendly. We'd definately look to stay here again.
