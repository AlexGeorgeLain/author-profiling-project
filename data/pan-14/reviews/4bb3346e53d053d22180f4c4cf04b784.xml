The room was compact but the best thing was the bed - probably even more comfortable than my own bed at home.The location is great, really central but quiet and peaceful. The staff were very friendly and even advised us on local transport. The place was very clean and although the breakfast was basic (cereal and croissants) it was adequate to set you up for a wander around this great city. I'd certainly stay there again - really good quality and good value too.
