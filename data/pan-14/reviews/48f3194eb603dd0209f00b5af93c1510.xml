The hotel room was huge and the breakfast food ample. We had four beds for four people. Even better was the attitude of the staff- store our luggage? No problem. When I told them that we were coming from all over and wanted to put all the names on the reservation so anyone could check in- Not a problem. And, when my plane was delayed and I asked them to pass on a message- they did it right away. It is walking distance to everything. It is clean. It is not fancy. nancy j
