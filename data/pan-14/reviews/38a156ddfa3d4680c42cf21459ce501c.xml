My pet peeve is noise and in our room, you couldn't tell anyone else was there. We didn't hear voices in the hall, other people flushing their toilets, ice machines - nothing. Pure silence. I slept like a baby. The convenience of the location is great - right off of Times Square. The staff couldn't have been nicer. It's pet friendly, too, and there were a lot of dogs (big dogs!) staying there but we never heard a single bark. The only complaint I have is that we couldn't buy the robe I wore. It is supposed to be for sale online but only the animal prints are and I wanted the tan one. The toiletries were really nice, BTW, and there were little extras that we didn't expect. If we're lucky enough to get back to NYC, we're definitely going to stay at The Muse.
