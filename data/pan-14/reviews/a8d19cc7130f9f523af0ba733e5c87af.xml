I hate to be the bearer of bad news but not only is NATURA PARK not the model environmentally aware corporate citizen, but its services are absolutely horrendous. First off, the reusable beach cups are gone; second off, bleach-free laundy was a marketing stunt and no longer applies as well. Thirdly, the service was bad. This especially holds true for front desk personnel who had the audacity to insult some members of my travelling party. Finally, a word of advice to those booking NATURA independantly outside a tour group ... DONT! We had confirmed pre-paid booking for 8 persons for 3 nights and they were given to tour groups and airline personnel with big contracts. As an independant traveller, I would avoid Natura Park because you never know if your reservation would be there. (Oh, we had confirmed our reservation 4 times via email and called 3 successive days prior to arrival).Cheers.PS: The beach is full of sea-weed anyways :(.
