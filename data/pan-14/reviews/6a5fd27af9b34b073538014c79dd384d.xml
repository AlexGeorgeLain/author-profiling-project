The staff could not have been more helpful or more friendly. Our room was excellent, we enjoyed the swimming pool on a number of occasions, returned each morning to the breakfast restaurant and relaxed to the different singers/musicians at night.Only complaint is that I believe that in this day and age every hotel should offer free wireless internet access.
