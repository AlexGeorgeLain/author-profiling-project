The beach is beautiful as well as the resort. We enjoyed the train that would transport you to and from your villa. The room was clean and lovely. We went on the excursion to swim with the sharks and stingrays, and we had a great party on the catamaran. This was my second time going to DR, but this trip was the most fun ever. We met many people that we hung around with. We enjoyed great night entertainment. Oh I can not forget to mention the swim-up pool bar. It was awesome. I would go back again. Great Vacation.
