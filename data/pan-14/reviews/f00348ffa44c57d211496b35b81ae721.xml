We didn't blame the hotel and they were very nice when we entered. Room was overpowering with a lemon scent when we entered but it soon dissipated. I think the maid service was a bit flamboyant with their sprays. Anyway, great shower (very important) and very clean room. Bed was comfortable. Our only issue was that we were on the seventh floor beside the service elevator which seemed to run all night. Parking was in the basement (room for about seven cars) and cost 15 euros a night. About a ten minute walk to the nearest tourist bus ( must!!) for tripping around the city. Neighborhood felt very safe when walking it at night and plenty of good restaurants around. The internet wireless connection was a bit dodgy. I had full signal but some sites like Yahoo.com and Boston.com were blocked for some reason and there was no help in sight. Still, I wasn't in Barcelona to se how life was at home so no big deal.
