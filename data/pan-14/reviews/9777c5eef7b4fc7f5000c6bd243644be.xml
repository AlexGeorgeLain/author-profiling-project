Its location is great; only a few minutes work to the Mongkok MTR station and only a quick 15min cab ride to central. The Langham Place is surrounded by great shops; it even has its own 13 story shopping mall across the street connected by a walkway.We booked a Club Level room online, and when we arrived we were escorted to a private check-in. Believe me, the Club rooms are well worth the extra price because they come with a huge range on complimentary services: free wired/wireless internet, free use of the gym/swimming pool, access to a private lounge on Level 36 and free breakfast.The hotel as a whole is great, as mentioned before. The dining options available are top notch, with a range of Western and Cantonese food available; the rooms are great; the roof top swimming pool and gym is first class and what is more, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.I recommend this hotel to anyone not scared off by the high prices, mind you we did stay there over New Years, so I presume it would be a fair bit cheaper at less popular times. The Club rooms are well worth the extra price. And the stay was just great all round.
