We had absolutely no problems. We were even able to extend our check out time!!The Sofitel is in a great location on 44th St. 2 blocks from the hubbub of Times Square, but the street is very quiet.The thing I was most impressed with was the feeling you received from the front desk staff, they seemed genuinely happy you were there and genuinely happy to be working. What a nice suprise!!!
