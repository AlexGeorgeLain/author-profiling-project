Our room was to the back of the hotel over looking a small courtyard it was quiet although there was some noise from an air conditioning unit until about midnight. The room though small was beautiful with high beamed ceiling and large very comfortable bed, the bathroom excellent, towels and toiletries replaced every day.The views from the roof terrace are breathtaking, we ate at the hotel restaurant on one occasion, quite expensive but well worth it for the atmosphere and views.The location is excellent, five minutes from the train and bus station and just a short walk to the centre.Only down side we found was the breakfast, quite basic for a four star hotel.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, we loved the character of the hotel and would definitely recommend it.
