(Check this out with your car co.)We drove to Ponce 1.5 hour pleasant drive thru mountains.I played 3 rounds of golf. The course is attractive and interesting but not memorable. No problem for a bogy golfer if you can stay out of the ponds. Holes #9 ,18 and 27 end on the ocean otherwise there are no other oceanviews.Food was not great . Sat night was an excellent pig roast with local specialties. Other buffet meals were not up to par.But if you are a big eater you will get your moneys worth.Wine list was expensive starting at $44. But if asked they offered a decent 'off the list wine' for $27Our best meal was 'Marks at the Melia' in Ponce. We went there once but if we had more time we would have gone back more.'Pitos' on the ocean wes also great for lunch. you can drive to Pitos,otherwise take a cab into the Ponce area unless you like to drive around lost and clueless in seedy enviorns.We drove to the famous Rain forest . Not worth the 5+ hour round trip in NYC style traffic. Shoud be OK from San Juan.Overall I agree with the positive reviews here.
