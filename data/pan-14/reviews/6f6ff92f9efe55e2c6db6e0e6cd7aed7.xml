Our apartment was spacious, bright, and spotless, with wonderful views over the rooftops to the domes and the campanile of the Basilica San Marco. The neighborhood was convenient and pleasant, lively during the day, quiet at night. In all of Venice, there can be no better hosts than Donatella, Guido, and Franca, all of whom made us feel completely at home throughout our stay, as did Cristina in the breakfast room. Because it is usually best, as well as a courtesy, to reserve for dinner at Italian restaurants, the telephone with free local calls was helpful. Many reviews mention how great this hotel is for families, but we also recommend it to couples who would enjoy a quiet, comfortable, attractive home-away-from-home. We could live there.
