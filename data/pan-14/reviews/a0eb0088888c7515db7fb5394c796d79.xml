The furnishings and decorating are premium, different, and lovely. The beds are extremely comfortable. We loved our lanai with a view of Diamond Head, as well as the beach [looking between two buildings]. I used the clean laundry facilities. The staff was greatly accomodating. As mentioned in previous reviews, the bathroom and closet are small, but the bathroom is quite elegant. We dined twice at the Walilana Coffee House next door. They have a nice, small salad bar, and the food was excellent and reasonable. There is a Subway and a McDonalds just down the street. If you are budget travelers as we are, you will like Long's Drugs in the Aloa Moana Mall. Go there first for groceries. For souvenirs, we shopped at the Swap Meet, as well as the International Marketplace. We used The Bus extensively for $2.00 each way with a transfer to get back.
