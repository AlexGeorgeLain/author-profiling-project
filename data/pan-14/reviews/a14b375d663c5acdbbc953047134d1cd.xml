Thanks to its direct bridge connection to the airport, this Hilton is an excellent location for an overnight stay near the airport -- and with the free shuttle to the airport subway station, it's also conveniently located for sightseeing trips into the city. We got a very good price the night we stayed, and thought about staying here again the following weekend but the price had more than doubled; it's an excellent $150 hotel but not worth $350!The rooms are modern, well furnished and clean, and those on the city side have a nice view of downtown. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. On-site food choices are somewhat limited and a bit pricey, but the bar is quite nice and you can get morning coffee and pastries in the lobby.
