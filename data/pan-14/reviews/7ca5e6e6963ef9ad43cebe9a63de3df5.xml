For young children I would recommend the Naiboa as the pool is the most child friendly. The same food is available there even though it is a 3* but the rooms are not up to the Bambu standard.The Bambu is so great that many from the two neighbouring 5*s came to our pool, which meant it was overcorwded sometimes.The family are going again later this year so it can't be bad at all.One of the best holidays I have had in the Caribbean (even if you take out the fact that it was my wedding day)with regard to the wedding, relax let them take care of it - mine went without a hitch they took care of all of the arrangements.
