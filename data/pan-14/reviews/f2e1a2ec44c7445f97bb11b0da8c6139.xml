However, it was 1.5 miles /2.4 Km from Westin Bonaventure Hotel, at 404 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, where I was attending a convention (8/2-8/9/08). Also, I often stay at other Clarions and Comfort Inns. I took a chance and was satisfied. Though the Olympic Blvd area is a combination of Hispanic and Koreatown, the people staying there are families, business people and others on a vacation. I did not go walking in area as I used my car to get around. The Clarion Hotel Downtown, 1901 West Olympic Blvd. Los Angeles CA 90006 (213) 385-7141 is two blocks east of S. Alvarado St. It is mostly on Bonnie Brae Street. That is the entrance that you enter (or thru the parking garage). Unfortunately, there is only one marked handicapped parking space.There is some under the hotel parking (if you're early in) and the rest is across the street in a fenced parking lot which is well-lighted (your key controls gate). The parking lot is between an apartment building and another motel. And, there is a Korean church beside the hotel. There is a Korean restaurant on the corner and a Sushi restaurant beside the front entrance on West Olympic Blvid. Bonnie Brae Street is a quiet street. There is a night guard on duty in the hotel's parking garage and he has two video screens to watch the outside parking lot, the parking garage (he's right next to the indoor one), all of the halls, pool area, two large patios, lobby, etc. I felt secure.I was impressed that there were usually three hotel personnel at the front desk most times. And, the manager was nearby. It is a Korean run hotel. They are pleasant and always kind. When someone parked their car too close behind mine in the parking garage, two women from the front desk kindly directed my backing out of the space. I found the Clarion clean, nicely decorated and the beds are great for sleeping. There are two elevators for the three floors. That's nice if one is not working properly, which can happen anywhere.My room had a wide screen tv [although, not all rooms have wide screens], a 1100 watt microwave with a turntable, an excellent refrigerator, coffeemaker, iron board, a gas-lift high back business chair with arm rests, a desk lamp and two phones (one on nightstand with dual lamps AM-FM clock radio).Fortunately, they had used an extension cord that one would plug in the refrigerator and microwave or coffee maker. That way, the freezer was not iced up as it would be if it were constantly on. I wish some other motels would defrost their refrigerator's freezers! The fluorescent lamps (14 watts) need more wattage in the bulbs. They equal about 50 watts which is not enough to easily read by. 23 watts=100 watts which would be better. (Hopefully, they'll use cool white bulbs, not the warm ones, which are yellow. Note: 3500 K temperature rated bulbs are bright white without having the ultraviolet rays of full-spectrum. Those would be perfect). My room overlooked the pool area. There are some rooms with a balcony, chairs and a table overlooking the pool. There are also two other areas that have large patios with chairs and tables in a courtyard on the 2nd floor. I did have trouble connecting with a cell phone tower due to being in the pool courtyard. It is always good to carry a prepaid phone card to use with the land-line...The air filter was clean! The only complaint I have is that the heating system is central, although you can turn on/off the air conditioner which is above the entrance way in your room. Althought this was the first week of August, the nights were cool to cold depending upon you metabolism. I turned off the AC and the thin comforter kept me somewhat warm. The hair dryer turned on and placed on the upside down metal trash basket was my heater. And, for those who'd like some fresh air, the sliding glass window can be opened; although, there is no screen.The water from the faucet was very hot. They could turn it down 30 degrees and still satisfy everyone, while wasting less energy. Fortunately, they used a easy to figure out shower control. Throughout the Choice Hotels chain of 11 branded hotel/motels, the shower heads vary and can be confusing. I wish they would standardize them with a handle and face plate that shows blue color for cold with an increasing combo of blue red color for warmthen, red for hot.There is no free continental breakfast. You buy your breakfast there...or elsewhere. Local calls are free and internet access is free although, the computer in the lobby is $3.00 for 30 minutes.
