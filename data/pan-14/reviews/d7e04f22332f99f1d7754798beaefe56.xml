In all of these areas I was completely satisfied with my stay, especially for the cost ($145 per night).By booking directly by phone, my parents and I were able to get a room with a balcony; we wound up in building five with a lovely shared balcony looking out onto Decatur. The balcony, which one has to climb out the window to access, was the best part of the room. In the lovely May weather we were able to sit outside and people-watch while we chatted and drank margaritas. The room itself was not new, which is to be expected based on the descriptions of the property--it was clean, however, and filled with antiques and furniture that was somewhat scuffed. We laughed that nothing in the room--from the prints on the walls to the large mirror on the wall to the actual air conditioner vent--hung straight. For us this was not a problem. We considered these aspects part of the hotel's charms, yet for others this may not be ideal. The staff on hand was very helpful and polite, and parking, I felt, was a steal: valet parking for $18 per night. That's good for the French Quarter.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for those looking for a quaint, affordable stay on this end of the French Quarter. With those criteria in mind, I have absolutely no complaints!
