We stayed at this hotel over the Valentines weekend this year and even the heaviest snow storms for many years didn't spoil our enjoyment of the hotel and NY as a whole. Service was excellent, the staff are extremely helpful, with one concierge happy to forego the opportunity of making some commission on the sale of theatre tickets by advising me to buy direct from the theatre at half the price!I would recommend this hotel as a great stay for couples for a long weekend or for business.

It's location is great, only a couple of minutes walk to the central train station and 5 minutes from the centre of Florence. One word of warning; if you get a room overlooking the street ask to be moved to another room as we got very little sleep on our 1st night due to traffic/general noise. Having said this, when we asked to be moved the next morning it was sorted out with no fuss and we were able to view the alternative room before we moved to make sure it was ok for us.Rooms are not huge but have all that you need for a few days stay and given some of the prices that you can pay for a hotel room in Florence I thought that this was very good value for money.
