It is a city that both my Husband and I have always wanted to visit. After extensive research i was recommended by a friend to check out the Design Hotels website... and after doing so fell in love with the look of Hotel Continentale. Reviews posted on this website were good, and the location was fantastic, the clean cut and contemporary design appealed to us, and we also came across a very good deal directly with Design Hotels (near enough half the normal price for a classic double room). This Hotel was fantastic and we were so glad we chose it. It is positioned on one end of the Ponte Vechio, literally, so perfectly positioned for everything we needed. We were lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor, with 2 balconies overlooking the street and the river. We could also see Plazzio Vechio, which looked stunning lit up at night. The room was very clean, contemporary, light and airy. The bathroom was very modern large, considering this is a city hotel. Overall this gave us a very good impression of Design Hotels, and i would definity book another Design Hotel in the future. Florence is gorgeous, and we simply couldn't fit everything in that there is to do and see... a return visit is definitely on the cards. If you are reading this then go - and spend a little extra and stay here - it is worth every penny.
