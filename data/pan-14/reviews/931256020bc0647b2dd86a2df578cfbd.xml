The newly renovated rooms are beautifully appointed and stocked, the staff are helpful and eager to please, and room service is reasonable and very good. The Westin is in easy walking distance to the arts district (if you are one of the 6 visitors to Dallas who chooses to walk to anything). However: if you are a light sleeper, this is not the hotel for you. Someone forgot the soundproofing, and the rooms that overlook the atrium - while a lot of fun - are the worst. With a function in full swing on a Saturday night, there was an echo chamber effect to the noise that was truly amazing. Not even a heavenly bed can overcome that ruckus. Also, for these rates...internet shouldn't be $9.95 a day!! It's the one flaw in their amenities.
