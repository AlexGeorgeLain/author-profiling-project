The staff was great and helped out even doing a rush job on cleaning a stained shirt. The second reason was being on the far end of the park from the harbor, very quiet and a nice walk to the harbor. The Pumphouse bar is connected to the end of the hotel, nice place for sure. The only downside was the internet access was a little expensive, something like $6.00 for 30 minutes. In the USA most hotels offer free internet access. Great acces to shops and Chinatown is just a few blocks away with some good markets, food etc.
