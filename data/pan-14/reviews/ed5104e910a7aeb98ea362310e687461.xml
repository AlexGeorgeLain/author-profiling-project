Had a great time the hotel was beautiful! One key point: ask to be close to the elevator for your room type. The building hallways wind and I was in room 620 and there is one way to the room and one way back to the elevator...long windy hallway that takes you in a circle! Plush beds, clean bathrooms and iron in room! Some of my team stayed in the Embassy around the corner....Wyndahm had better bathrooms and beds than the Embassy-I saw first hand! (And was $50 cheaper!/night!)The front desk staff was nice folks and the bell man was very sweet. They let me leave my bags in the bag storage area ALL day (post check out) to go see the city and tour. Came back to get my bags at 9pm!In house restaurant kinda pricey so did not eat there. Riverwalk is across the street: eateries and shopping! Yeah!Nice location two blocks north of convention center which was where I needed to be all weekend!Highly recommend!
