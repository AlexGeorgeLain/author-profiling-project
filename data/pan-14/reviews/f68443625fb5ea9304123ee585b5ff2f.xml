The hotel is also a conference center so it had a beautiful lobby, several ballrooms, ample grounds plenty of parking. The rooms were larger than other comparable hotels we stayed in during our trip. The view from our room was magnificent - overlooking the pool and mountains in the background. The food was fine and it was the only hotel we stayed at in Italy which had an ice machine! The only drawback to this hotel was the fact that it was not situated in downtown Florence. There was a hotel shuttle to from downtown but you had to mind the schedule or take a cab. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the hotel and service.
