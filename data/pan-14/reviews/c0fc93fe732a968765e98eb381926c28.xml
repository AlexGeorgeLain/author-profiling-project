The rooms are fab: huge beds, lovely balcony, great aircon (which is vital), the pool is gorgeous- tree lined and lit up at night and the staff are really friendly. It's quiet whihc is good if you're looking for that type of thing and is definitely more families and couples. It also doubles as a Spa and they do great massages.I'd recommend the pick up from the airport as it's pretty mental when you land in Bali.The location is the only slight downside. Your are pretty close to the airport whihc is convenient but isn't apparent as it's so quiet.It's about a 5 min taxi ride from here into Central Kuta (which cost next to nothing) but there are a few bars and restaurants nearby. The beach isn't great here. It's a good 15-20 min walk round to the more golden sands of Kuta or ataxi ride.
