Brilliant location, everything a walk or tram ride away, we walked most places. Hotel was lovely and clean and our room on the fifth floor was huge and was located on the corner part of the hotel. Breakfast was plentiful, no complaints. Room spotless and the bed was very comfy with a good choice of pillow. Staff very helpful. Only complaints, the air con was set to high which made the room very stuffy, tried opening the windows but as the Dutch and holiday makers didnt' quiet down till 5am, this made the room to noisy. But we survived the broken sleep, however older people may prefer somewhere a little quieter in the summer months
