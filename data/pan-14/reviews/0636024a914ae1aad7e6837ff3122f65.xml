This is great hotel, very clean and rooms beautifully decorated. The staff were very friendly and i could,nt ask for more. Location very good and metro only round the corner. For value and quality this hotel is very good.

The location was great 10 minutes walk to darling harbour and circular quay 15 minutes walk. It does have a fair enough pool and jacuzzi on roof top. The 2 bedroom apartment which we had is in need of complete reservation and had pictures that were out in the 80,s that is probably the last time it had been refurbished. The reception are is so bare with grubby carpet and lacks athmosphere. That area of oxford street is not the safest at night, sa a few incidence that were quite frighting. There is good leisure centre beside austrailia museum and the convict museum is worth a visit.A bit of care and attention would lift this hotel to a decent place to stay
