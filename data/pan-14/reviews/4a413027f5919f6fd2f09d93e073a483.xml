There is also a cable car line station very close, you can see the cable car turning and get in to a pleasant ride passing through Lombard street, to the docks nightlife and touristic area.The hotel hasn't got really any attractive feature... the restaurant is new and quite fashioned, and it has a cheap and really close parking area. The rooms and the passageways are not so fancy... it's clear that this is an old building, somehow reformed and refurbished, we actually didn't find anything that bothered us... it was pretty clean and the personnel was keen on helping for whatever we asked.It is a good solution if you're looking for a cheap solution in a central area (other luxury hotels are located nearby), and a good deal for the money you spend since you're really close to lots of areas of interest. Even if the commercial district is not the main nightlife zone in fog city, we were able to find good bars with live jazz music and lots of restaurants.
