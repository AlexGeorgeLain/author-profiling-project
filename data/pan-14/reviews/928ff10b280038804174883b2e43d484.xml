This was our first trip to New York and we chose this hotel because of the quiet location and large rooms. It was such a relief after 15 hours travelling to arrive at a hotel in another country and not be disappointed. The hotel was relaxing, the rooms were spotless, beds comfy, staff very helpful and friendly. There was plenty of space for the four of us and the kitchenette was great for breakfasts and snacks. We were only two blocks away from the subway and great shopping and restaurants. Central Park was just 10 minutes walk and there was a handy grocery store just down the road to stock up on essentials. We had a fabulous holiday and would definitely stay at Affinia Gardens again, we felt we had chosen the right location as hotels in mid-town would have been too noisy - highly recommended.
