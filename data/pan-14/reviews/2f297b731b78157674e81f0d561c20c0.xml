Our room was ready for us when we arrived at 8:30 a.m. We had the king size bed with a balconey overlooking the harbour. Everything about the room was a-1. It was clean, comfortable and the price was reasonable. Also the breakfasts were excelent.The only problem was we thought we were using a phone card to call ct. in the usa, but really were using their phone line. Be aware of phone rates to the states.Overall we would stay there anytime and be well taken care of.
