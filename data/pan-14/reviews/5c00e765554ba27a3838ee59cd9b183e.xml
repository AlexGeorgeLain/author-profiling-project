The room got really stuffy and couldn't sleep all night! The bedding was dirty and so were the towels. I can't believe expedia rated this hotel as a 3 star..The room quality was dated..Not to mention the 19 dollar parking fee plus 2 dollar tip..So the total cost 161 plus 3 bottle waters= 164.00. Are you kidding me? Oh yea I also got sick from not sleeping..Not a good trip needless to say...!!
