We arrived about 11.00 and were able to check in straight away. The staff could not have been more helpful. Yes it is a business hotel bu we felt right at home.The bar manager was very friendly and came over to the table where we ate prior to the theatre to make sure we were ok. Advice on restaurants was given; the proximity to cable cars, shops and touristy things was fantastic.
