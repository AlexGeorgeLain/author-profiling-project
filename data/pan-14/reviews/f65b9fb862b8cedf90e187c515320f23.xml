Had a deluxe room which I felt was quite pricey but because of the reviews on this sight felt I was going to get what I paid for. The room (requested a twinbedded room) was on the top floor and very small with not much space to hang our clothes (by the way we only went for 3 nights). Very handy for the airfrance bus from Charles de Gaulle airport. Room very dusty and bathroom very small. The bathrobes provided were extra large which drowned my sister and I , considering the French by and large are petite ,thought this was a great insult. The breakfast was an additional optionand it was inadequate and overpriced and the service was dreadful as the only waiter was also doing all the in room breakfasts whilst trying to keep up with restocking the very uninteresting breakfast selection and providing drinks. The hotel was in a quiet street t but miles away from anywhere except the Arc de Triomphe. If you want to walk from here to see the sights forget it.
