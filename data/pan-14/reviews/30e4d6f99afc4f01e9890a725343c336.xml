Right by the wharf, next door to the Trolley Turn Around, across the street from the Buena Vista... what else could you ask for? How about one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had?? This place is wonderful. We arrived and upgraded our room to a suite. Mind you this is a HUGE hotel when it comes to finding your room. The halls are long but well lit and beautifully decorated. We arrive at our suite and you feel like you are walking into a home. 8 place dining table, flat screen TV (2 of them) DVD player, living room group, then off to the bedroom... here was this awesome king bed (totally did not want to get out the next morning), the most spectacular furnishings and in the closet are two leopard print bathrobes (kind of funny actually)! The bathroom had marble counters and floor and a Jacuzzi tub that fit two people easily. The employees of the hotel went out of their way to help us find excellent dining choices and were so unexpected. Large cities are not known for the hotel staff going out of their way unless they have their hand out! Have traveled a lot and seen many sights and this was a great place. Mind you that it is only 4 levels, and the wharf can be a noisy place so it is not like staying in the country but alas that is part of its charm. We have told everyone about this lovely place!
