Family Package which included, buffet breakfast and a welcome amenity). My wife, two children (ages 3 and 7) and I were in one of the larger guest corner rooms with two queen beds, including access to the executive floor. On arrival we were greeted in our room by a large basket of fresh fruit and in the evening we got one complimentary pizza for each (just watch ouot that the room delivery is not complimentary, so it is charged). We requested a babysitter to take care of the kids on Sat night and even though it took several days of emailing and calling the hotel they finally confirmed it the day before. Once you get to talk to the hotel Concierge you are done, so don't talk with the lobby.In general the service is wonderful and the hotel is at the level of a 5-star hotel. It was an expensive weekend get-away with the family but worth every penny.Finally, I think the hotel works great for business travelers. Apart from the obvious things it is located in front of a tram stop and across the street there's a very big fair-exhibition site complex.
