The breakfast was a nice variety and beautifully served. The location is amazing. Two blocks to the Duomo, a few blocks to the Uffizi and Pontevecchio. We walked everywhere, didn't need a taxi. Florence was very clean and wonderful, although quite expensive.Would highly recommend the Calzaiuoli and would stay there next visit. I am a travel agent and will include it in my list for my clients.
