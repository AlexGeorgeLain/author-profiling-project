We wanted a place a little outside the center of town where it would be quieter and grant us easier access to other parts of the city that we would be seeing on this trip. My wife needed wireless internet access in order to stay somewhat connected to work, and the hotel offers this at no extra charge. This might seem minor, but for us it was a decisive factor in our choosing to stay at the Hotel Giglio over other hotels in the same area.The hotel is a very nice, little place. The rooms are small, but very clean and comfortable. Our room had a very effective (but quiet) AC unit, and since we like to sleep in a cold room, this was great for us. The bed gave us a very nice night's sleep.The staff is wonderful. Roberto and his brother who own the hotel are there at all times making sure everything is being taken care of properly. The rest of the staff is equally pleasant and helpful.The breakfast is not just a muffin and some jam. You can have fruit, yogurt, pastry, cereal, etc, etc. A nice cappuccino or tea as well if you so desire.We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Giglio and recommend it if you're looking for a place to stay.
