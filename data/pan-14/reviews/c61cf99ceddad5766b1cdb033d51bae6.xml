Whilst I wouldn't necessarily give it a 5, a 4 is definately a fairer representation, I would say.Firstly, I would say all the usual requirement boxes were checked:*Comfy bed* Modern Clean bathroom.* Modern decor in bedroom.* Flat screen satelite tv etc.However, I have three (main) pro's for this hotel...1.) Great Central Location... very close to London Bridge Tube Station, making all other tube stops easily accessible.2.) Room we stayed in seemed to be well sound proofed, quite crucial given the close proximity to the tube line. I am a very light sleeper and I was not distrubed once in the night/morning at all.3.) Great breakfast... although I understand you normally have to pay for this seperately, ours was included as part of the deal for the room.RECOMMENDATION...We booked through LateRoom.Com and got the room at a competitive price compared to London Bridge's own website prices, our rate also included the breakfast, which would've been (as I recall) somewhere in the region of per person... so is worth checking out this booking agent.Although, I would say its worth ringing on morning of your arrival (as I did) to confirm whether you have been allocated a double or a twin room. We wanted a double but had been allocated a twin room... as it happened there was no problem changing to a double room at late notice and there was no extra charge for this either. Just a point worth noting.
