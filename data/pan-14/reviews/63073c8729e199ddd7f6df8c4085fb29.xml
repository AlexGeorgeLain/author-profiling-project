It's centrally located, many places easily walkable. Hotel is full of character, being previously the Federal Bank building. Lounge areas and bar were beautiful. Good bar menu too. Main restaurant, The Julien, rather French and fancy for our tastes, but obviously very upmarket. Piano player in the bar in the evenings added a nice ambiance. Breakfasts not unduly expensive and you could buy a la carte, so not having to pay full buffet price for just coffee and croissants. Our room was very pleasant and comfortable (had to change from the one first allotted because that was very small). Very comfy beds, nice smooth and soft cotton bedlinen, towels changed twice a day.Also room very quiet - not a noisy hotel - all guests respected other people, which was a refreshing change in today's world of hustle and bustle.Overall, a very good choice for a few days in Boston, and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel.
