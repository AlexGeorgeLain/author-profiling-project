There is a nice boulangerie outside the hotel. There are loads of restaurants in the vicinity but they are all touristy so I wouldn't recommend any of them. I would agree with the previous posts about the noise on Saturday night but the easy solution to that problem is to just party till 3 and then you'll come home to peace and quiet.
