We had a view right out at ground zero which I did not see since 9-11 so it was a learning experience as far as accesing the damage. The room service was great and the mini bar is a tease but for those prices I could not touch it. So I advise anyone who stays to not look in there because it 's gonna get you. I would recommend this to all peole for all different reasons.
