I got a great rate for Sun-Tues 4/23-4/25/06 so I could attend the French Quarter Fest on Sun and celebrate my birthday on Mon. My room was an interior one and very quiet--the room was immaculate and service was great! The manager(John) and the front desk attendant(Velda) were very personable and very helpful. I arrived early in the morning (8am) and the desk clerk that day(didn't catch her name) found me a room that was ready, which I hadn't expected. I would definitely return here. The mattress on my king bed was excellent--got a great night's sleep both nights. After many hours of walking both days, it was definitely appreciated. The location is wonderful--just a half block from Bourbon. I highly recommend this hotel!
