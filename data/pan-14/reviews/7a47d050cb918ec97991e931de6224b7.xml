The location is brilliant, merely a few steps to the Duomo and Florence being so manageable on foot, it is centrally located to all the sights we went to (Ponte Vecchio, Uffizi, Accademia etc). It's only a 15 minute walk to the central train station.The hotel is clean and we can't find a fault with it although we wished the bathroom was better lit and the hot water would sometimes gradually turn icy cold in the midst of a shower. Brrrr... Your just have to point the shower head away and wait for it to turn hot again. The weather was cool and sometimes very cold at night during our stay, so we did not require air conditioning or a fan. It was cosy to snuggle up. :)The breakfast is decent considering standard European fare. They had yoghurt, fruit and boiled eggs amongst the normal bread, cereal, coffee/tea and juice. We would stay in this hotel again.
