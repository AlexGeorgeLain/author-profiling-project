We looked at several places online but decided on the W. The hotel is very modern, which is not my taste - however everything is done extremely well. The service is excellent and when I checked in Tracy Morgan of 30 Rock was in line in front of me. The W is just a few blocks from the UCLA campus and within walking distance of the Westwood Theater and Shopping district. We are part of the Starwood network and because of this we were upgraded to a suite on the 6th floor. The short version: Not the cheapest hotel in the area but worth every cent if you want to be treated like a celebrity.
