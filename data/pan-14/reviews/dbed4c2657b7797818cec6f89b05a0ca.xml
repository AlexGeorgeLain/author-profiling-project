We decided to celebrate our Silver Wedding with a trip to Venice as we had visited on our honeymoon and had loved it.We arrived at about 11.15 am after a 6.45 flight from the UK, so were feeling very tired, we were shown straight to our room and had a rest for a couple of hours. The room was beautiful and even though it had a four poster bed and 3 single beds there was plenty of room, we also had a balcony overlooking the courtyard and a hydrotherapy bath, which was lovely for sore feet.We stayed for 5 nights and the staff were lovely and the breakfasts were so good, I still think about those lovely warm apricot croissants.This was such a peaceful and quiet spot, it was brilliant to get back after the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas, but within a few minutes were some lovely restaurants and bars. We ate at La Zucca twice and it was great, I must also recommend Al Nono Risorto where the food was really good and very reasonably priced. On our last evening we went into Campo San Giacomo dell'Orio and sat in the square and had some lovely wine at Al Prosecco, my daughter went to the toilet and when she came out she informed us that this was Emma Thompson's local - lucky Emma Thompson.We had a fabulous stay and I was very sad to come home, I would love to go back and I would love to stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you to Valter and Sandro and your lovely staff.
