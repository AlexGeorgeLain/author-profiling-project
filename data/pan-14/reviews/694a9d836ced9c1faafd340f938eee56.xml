We found the hotel to be extremely comfortable, clean, friendly and good value for money. We received a welcome drink, plus complementary breakfast ( excellent) which included champagne, and cakes and coffee from 5-7 p.m, plus tickets to the Dali exhibition. It is in an excellent location minutes from the metro. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and would love to go back in the summer. The only thing that spoiled our stay was the theft of our video camera from the Hard Rock Cafe. We were warned beforehand that Barcelona is notorious for thefts but were still caught out. Fortunately we were lucky enough to get it back , thanks to the staff at the Hard Rock, but be do be aware of pickpockets and thieves.
