Arrival at the hotel was slightly later than intended due to a 1.5 hour delay on the Eurostar and a long wait for a taxi at Gare du Nord but the welcome was extremely warm on arrival. Lift up to our room could only be described as cosy but it served it's purpose none the less. Room was beautifully and tastefully decorated and exactly what I hoped for when I initially booked the trip. Breakfast the next morning was adequate enough for us to fill up on before our exploration of the city - comprised of various pastries, cold meats cheeses. The reception staff were extremely helpful throughout and spoke perfect English....which was very handy as my attempt at broken French was struggling to say the least!!! Didn't use the Metro but there is a stop about 100 yards away. A walk down to Champs Elysee took around 20 minutes.
