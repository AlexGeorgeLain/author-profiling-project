The Hotel Luxer was such a lovely hotel with pleasant staff, good morning breakfast and knowing that the hotel is secure made our stay perfect. The sound of the church bells was lovely (once you got used to them) The Hotel is just around the corner from the red light district, 5 minutes walk from Central Station and Dam Square and is surrounded by an abundance of restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Amsterdam is such a lovely place and We will surely be going again in the near future, hopefully in the summer. The weather is very much like England. The only thing that was scary were the beggers and pimps. Also be wary, you will be offered all kinds of things whilst walking down the streets, especially around the red light district. Ladies leave you handbags at the hotel.
