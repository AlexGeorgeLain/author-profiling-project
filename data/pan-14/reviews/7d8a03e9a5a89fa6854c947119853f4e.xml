The rooms could use some work but they are large and clean, the location is the best. Hardly had to wait for the and the service in the restaurant was way above what we received anywhere else. The price of 5.00 for a cup of coffee was terrible, but the service made up for it. Service just about everywhere else was terrible, as we where in a party of six the restaurants put on a surcharge of 15%-20%, had the service been okay we would have not had a problem. The people of New York are charming, had heard they where unfriendly and rude, totally the opposite. What did amaze us is the police are everywhere, we felt very safe walking at night and down Canal Street. wait to go again and would stay at the Hilton Times Square again. Next trip we will buy all of our theater and sporting tickets in advance as it is hard to impossible to get the best seats for the popular shows when you are there. The concierge was a real asset, they made our dinner reservations, had maps and gave a lot of great advise about what we should do, and what not to miss and mostly they where right on.
