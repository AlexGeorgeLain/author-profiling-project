We were expecting it to be noisy but the friendly receptionist found us a quiet room at the back of the hotel away from the traffic and street noise. In fact, we were able to sleep with the window open. There was some noise from other guests returning late (very late!) but it wasn't bad considering the hotel is used by package deal companies.The hotel is immediately next to a Metro station entrance (Paral-lel) and a short walk to La Rambla, Plaza de Espana and the nice Port Vell area. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there are several cake shops serving nice pastries and fantastic coffee very close. (Coffee + pastry 1.70 Euros!)Our slight complaint would be that it is only marginally 4 star, more like a superior 3 star. But it was excellent value for money.
