The staff was not at all friendly or very helpful.The free bicycles are a welcome perk, but they book up VERY quickly. The breakfast room was very small and crowded and not much of a selection after staying at other hotels in Italy.We had a room in the front. It was extremely noisy every night from street traffic and very loud pedestrians.I did not feel safe walking on the streets by myself as I had other cities, including Rome.
