Got an excellent rate online which was about a third of the advertised rate. Very convenient for Dulles with an efficient shuttle service thrown in.Bar/Dining/Mini Bar etc all about what you'd expect from this class of hotel, eg-$6 for a beer.Overall recommended for business or leisure although the hotel obviously aims at the former.Would definitely stay here again, and thats even after tripping up getting out of the cab and spraining my thumb and grazing my knee. Enjoy!!!
