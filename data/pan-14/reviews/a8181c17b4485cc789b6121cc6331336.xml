It was freezing cold , us being from LA, and we didnt know what to expect of the hotel. But when we arrived the staff was very friendly and made us feel really comfortable. This hotel is perfect for business travel, excellent for families, and for a couple of single girls like us ready to party! We felt very safe and the surrounding neighborhood was safe as well. We recommend visiting the Olympic Diner around the corner for food any time and most places deliver so ask the front desk for menus. We booked the Double Double Room with 2 double beds, 1 bath, and a small area with a sink, microwave, fridge , and coffee maker. We have stayed at other hotels in NY and were impressed with the room size. It was 3 of us in a room but with 4 it still would have been comfy. Book this place and you will get oyur money's worth.

Overall, my experience wasnt bad. Let's start with the pro's: 2 blocks from Union Square, good sized bathroom with whirpool jet baths, small clean kitchen area in suites with utensils and stove, free internet in the lobby, continental breakfast, front desk was very helpful @ helping me find a number of eateries and directions to places. Cons: sketchy part of town (Dont walk around at night alone, day is ok just stick to Post St and the areas surrounding Union Square), Carpet needed cleaning. I had a comfy stay at the Beresford Arms and people who arent too picky would enjoy it as well.
