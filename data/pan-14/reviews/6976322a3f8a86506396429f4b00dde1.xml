This is simply put: the BEST hotel in the world. It's beyond 6 stars and they can do no wrong.We booked an S class limo service from the airport and from the moment we arrived at the hotel, they had staff and porters waiting for us. The staff to guest ratio is incredible and you always feel that someone is nearby to assist. They took us immediately to our rooms where check in staff were on hand with arrival documents. Our bags came quickly thereafter and we were free to enjoy the incredible views of Tokyo that this hotel offers. The hotel sits atop an office building and has 30th+ floor views of the mountains, the city (Ginza is down the road) and you can see parts of the Imperial Palace's park lands.The premier grand deluxe rooms were breathtaking. Extremely spacious by any standard and exceptionally luxurious. The details are what matter here: a hand written note card tells you the day's weather information and tomorrow's; everything automated and electronic (including blinds and curtains); HDTV flatscreen; iPod plug in point; yoga mats and umbrellas; walk in wardrobe area; separate spa bath and open style shower... You couldn't ask for a better appointed room. And like the earlier reviews mentioned, the little hand through closet at the door is a very well conceived idea for the room. They delivered messages and newspapers without ever having to knock.We also enjoyed the inclusive breakfast every morning. You can order eggs a la carte/any style and there was the great buffet. More fusion style than simply Japanese, and they had a nice selection of beverages. We also had one business lunch in the all day dining restaurant and the food and service was very good. The only complaint we had here was that the coffee service was a tad bit slow every morning. We also invited friends over to enjoy the views at the tea lounge near the Mandarin Bar. We had tea, drinks, and some Chinese appetizers and the staff were not only attentive and friendly, but the service is non-instrusive in a nice and discreet way.We also used the gym everyday. The treadmills have views over the entire city and the large flat screens with wireless headsets made running very enjoyable. The gym is well equipped and the fresh juices and fruit are a nice touch. The staff person there was always helpful and on hand to make your work out productive. On our first time, he recommended the spa on the 37th floor which was free of charge if you use the gym. We followed his advice and went down to use the spa pools and sauna/steam room. This had to be the best and most relaxing thing activity in all of Tokyo. The views from the spa pools are hard to beat!The other thing we noticed that was exceptional was the house keeping staff were always on top of everything and you never saw them. A house keeping trolley was never in sight! They always knew when we weren't there somehow and they would always make up the room and do the turn down service. The aromatherapy bowl in the turn down service was a very nice touch prior to bed time.Another example of how great the level service is: hotel staff bow everytime you walk by and wait for you to pass. They wait for lift/elevator doors to close before moving on. And above all else, they have the just say yes attitude which makes everything a joy.I would highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure (although Roppongi would be a better location for leisure travellers). The subway is just downstairs and very convenient and there is plenty to do at this location (the office building has a food court and shops). If you are debating which hotel to stay at in Tokyo, you will not only get the best in Tokyo here, but the best in the entire world.

She was very helpful and gave great advice and restaurant suggestions. Her and her staff truly care about their guests and their breakfasts and happy hours were like social gatherings. We had trouble finding the place at first (turned down the wrong street), but I called the hotel and eventually found our way. The facade was being redone so it obscured the front of the building. Finally we saw the small sign for the hotel and went up the very reliable elevator to the 3rd floor. The reception was a great preview of what was to come. This hotel is very new and modern. It felt hip and cool even! They offered us coffee while we waited and then took us a floor up to our room at the back of the hotel. The viewwas okay but there was a lot of natural light and the room was just great. Everything felt new and was very, very modern. For the rate (off season), it was a great deal I think.The bed was good and the lounge bench to the side folds out to become a second bed. The bathroom was small, but perfectly fine. We liked theA/C-heating unit which can be controlled with a remote. The TV was a flatscreen and also good. The breakfast was really good actually, but I think the coffee out at cafes is better. The lounge area is cozy and they have all the good travel guides you can read up on. The laptop with free internet is also a nice touch, as is the free WiFi all around.The location was great. Only 5-8 minute walk from the train station, 2 minutes to the Duomo and it's really centrally located. The shoppingis on your doorsteps and the sights are only 5-10 minutes away. I really can't think of any downsides to the place. I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly and it's nice for a quiet romantic getaway!

It is a very basic sort of hotel that's efficiently run and managed. The rooms are pretty small, somewhat gritty due to the high turn over, but usually the price is really good so you can score a great deal.It seems that a lot of airlines use this hotel for their aircrew as I've always seem plenty of flight attendants waiting in the lobby (it's pretty close to the airport actually, but still in a good spot in the city).Although the location is perfect for public transportation (train is a 5-10minute walk underground and buses are all around) and only a 5 minute walk to Chinatown/Darling Harbour, you'll be better off staying further in midtown Sydney (perhaps at Avillon, World Square, or places nearby. Hilton is too expensive, but very, very luxurious and great location).Overall, I would recommend this place as a nice, but relatively cheap place to stay. Not sure what it's like now though on the inside...

The rate was pretty good for off season, but I was concerned about the location as it's not in the main touristy areas. I need not have worried as it was just perfect. In fact, it was good to be off the beaten path a bit as the area felt very local and was very quiet. Not too many tourists stomping around and you're only a few stops on the vaporetto away from everything. It's also only about 15 minute walk to Piazza San Marco.I recommend reading about the vaporetto and how to use it. We got out of the train station and knew exactly where to be and what to do. There were lots of disorientated tourists. The hotel is very easy to find and the you know you're onto a good place as soon as you see the nice little courtyard entryway. The reception people were all extremely friendly and helpful. It rained both days so they gave us complimentary umbrellas too. Our room was upstairs on the canal side (not the grand canal) and we had a beautiful view. The room itself felt very grand and much more expensive that it really was. The bathrooms and everything were modern and the antique furniture in the room is great.We never got a chance to try the the free breakfast as we decided to sleep in, but it was served downstairs by the courtyard. We heard about the great gelato place right behind the hotel, but it was closed until January or so while the owners were on vacation. We found another gelato/crepe place a few bridges behind it and that was great. The vaporetto was extremely easy to use and I recommend the passes (depending on how long you stay). If you want a cheap gondola ride, try the targhettos that locals use to cross the river where there's no bridge. They were only 50 cents and quite fun (standing room only). The location of the hotel was good also as it was very close to the fish/fruit markets by the Grand Canal, and the Rialto bridge was also nearby.Signs are clearly marked which tell you which direction the big squares and landmarks are, but I found that the maps made the place look bigger than it was. Venice is very accessible and quite small. Try to also find a map that has detailed streets as there are a lot of alleyways, etc.Anyway, I really recommend this hotel. It's very quaint and a nice little hideaway. It was nice to come back to a warm place during the heavy rains.

The first time was in a standard room, but still very large and comfortable. The second time, was upgraded to a corner deluxe room that had wrap around windows, beautiful views of the Hudson river, and a very well equipped and large bathroom.The major plus of this hotel is location, location, location! Right in the heart of Times Square, very accessible, near Port Authority bus terminal, and the subway stop. But you do pay for the premium of location.The downside of this hotel is that the rooms feel stuffy. The windows don't really open so it is quite humid in the rooms and my corner room with a view had slight smoke smell problem, even though it was a nonsmoking room.The hotel's lobby is very nice and totally quiet/private as it's two floors up from the street level. Concierge were always busy as the hotel has many guests with families to contend with. I would recommend this hotel to families, tourists, and first time visitors to New York.

Like the Westin Times Square, the location is absolutely perfect, but the entry way could be a little better/more obvious if you ask me.The security was really good with a guard on duty at the street level all day. The lobby is upstairs in the hotel's tower so it's very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the streets of Times Square. The location is right next to the AMC cinema and near the subway.The rooms were very large for our 3 person family staying there. In a way, it's not as nice as the Westin in terms of luxury feeling, but it is very upscale for the average Hilton hotel. The only weird thing was on check-in, I had gotten there before my parents and they wouldn't let me go up to the room because I didn't have the credit card used during the booking, but that wasn''t a major deal.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to families and tourists in New York.

Despite this being a Four Seasons property, it is certainly not of the usual 5 stars Four Seasons standard. Got a standard room on the 7th floor and it has a very Westin feel to it. The hotel is very obviously somewhat dated, but the staff do a good job with upkeep and maintaing the luxury feeling somewhat.Bathroom was quite sufficient, but mostly spartan in terms of the bath products provided. The room is basic 90s style with old style hotel phone, but at least the room came with high speed internet and an ethernet plug for the laptop. TV channels weren't bad, but the TV was quite small.The free breakfast provided downstairs at Capers was great. Very international breakfast with typical eggs, pastries, and continental choices, but also dim sum/dumplings and other Asian and Indian selections. It was a huge feast.,The conference facilities were actually top notch with plenty of high class and roomy meeting spaces on numerous floors. Although the hotel layout is quite awkward, the terraced layout makes for a very large feeling hotel and it seems there's lots of explore. The hotel also abounds with choices for restaurants and you can see the nice pool from the Capers restaurant dining area (maybe a little weird for swimmers).The level of service here is just okay. I was constantly interrupted by house keeping throughout the day and wish their service was a little more discreet in timing/presence. They had over 8 check-in staff at the counter, but none of them offered to show me to m room. The check-in lady also did not point out where the elevators were and assumed I had known. The bell boy was very efficient however and my suitcases came up to my room in less than 10 minutes. The conference sevice staff were very efficient and friendly. Although at times some of them seem very young and new to the job.Finally, location is quite good. At the very end off the Orchard Road area. The new St. Regis is finishing up right across the street. I think you should stay at other hotels further down. Regent is about a 10 minute walk to the main bustling shoppping area of Orchard Road and there is certainly where Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt beat them out. So, this isn't exactly a real Four Seasons, but it is still quite nice and a classic luxury hotel.

The rooms are quite large, the bathrooms spacious, and the views were pretty good (can see parts of Hong Kong Harbour). Only major problem is location: it's not that bad, you can walk 10mins to get to the main part of Kowloon's shopping areas, but the main InterContinental hotel that's right on the Harbour has a better location.We arranged for a limo car Benz service from the airport, which is very convenient. Although we went to the airport via train on the way back, which is also very easy.Did not use the gym or the restaurants; much better food for cheaper around Hong Kong. I would overally recommend this hotel if you can score a really cheap rate (which we did), but would suggest you stay either near Central in Hong Kong side or the main InterContinental on Kowloon side.
