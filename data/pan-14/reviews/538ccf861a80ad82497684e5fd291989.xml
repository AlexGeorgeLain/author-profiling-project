We booked it through a last minute deal and didn't really know what to expect but as we were only there for 3 nights and got it cheap we didn't care. The rooms were spotless, a good size and cleaned daily. The staff were helpful and polite and the location couldn't have been better. Just off Kurfurstendam it was really close to shops, restaurants, buses and the train station. We will definitely be back. Can't wait!
