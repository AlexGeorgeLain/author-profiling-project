The hotel was modern and sparkling. Stunning atrium entrance. The room was clean, although no tea/coffee making facilities. We had breakfast at the LA Cafe - wide choice and efficient staff. Still don't know why they allow smoking in public areas or in restaurants. I suppose they'd lose 40% of their clientele. The spa area was very nice as well. Also we made full use of the club lounge - open bar from 6pm -snacks during the day. Nothing like popping in for an aperitif or several nightcaps. Highly recommended.
