The hotel's location is a bit out of the main tourist areas but is served well efficiently, to from the hotel with the 15 minutes shuttle leaving from NH Barbizon Palace, opposite Centraal Station.The rooms are of high standards with all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star rated property despite it actually having an official 3 stars. It deserves better. Bathrooms are very clean and more than well equipped. Constantly the toileteries' selection is more generous than most other hotel companies I have stayed with. TV with few English and European Channels are avaialble in the rooms. Beds are very comfortable. The check-in staff are polite and helpful and they do actually try to remember that you stayed here before! Also I get to meet the Northwest Airlines Flight-crew in the mornings, everytime when I am checking out and they are leaving for Schiphol for their flight. Overall a highly recommended hotel for an extremely reasonable price.
