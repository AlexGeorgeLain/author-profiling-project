Very centrally located, right off the Dam and a ten min walk to the central rail station. Base rm rate about $200 /nite.Room: small of course, quite typical for EU, but since travelling alone, was fine (suspect was even in a double occupancy room - can't imagine being particularly comfortable if had to share). Clean, but only fair in terms of bed comfort, queen (full?) sized bed.Bathroom: practially performing yoga routine to get into shower: big step up and a big step down, not so easy for those of us not exactly tall. Not recommended for anyone with any minor mobility issues. Very small but adequate. Not much vanity space for toiletries, problematic if travelling with a +1.Dining: ate dinner at hotel restaurant, was decent, homey Dutch-style cuisine, ok since a winter trip. Breakfast buffet was actually nicer than ok: typical selections plus a couple hot options (really nice bacon actually - a splurge for breakfast for me). Staff VERY friendly and helpful!!!
