We arrived at around 10:30 AM and our room was surprisingly ready. They also upgraded us to a partial ocean view on the 17th floor. This is a remodeled hotel and they have done a wonderful job. Even though it is not on the beach, it is close to everything. 3 blocks from the beach and shopping. Being alittle away from the beach is actually a plus in our book since it is less busy and quieter. The pool area is so serene and gorgeous. They also provide Otter Pops which is a fun touch, along with the Pixy Stix at the front desk! All of the hotel staff were attentive and helpful. The beds are amazingly comfortable. If I had to think of one negative it would be the shower which is very small, but I think they did a good job with what they had to work with. Another HUGE plus at this hotel is the Chill Room - there are 8 massage chairs in this room which is perfect at the end of the day. I wish I could have taken one home! If you are looking for a huge chain hotel, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a relaxing new boutique hotel, I would say give the Wyland a try. We are very glad we did!
