Small, modern, clean, on the minimalist side, with young and friendly staff. The rooms have a fair size - for my wife and I it was perfect. For American standards rather small. Our room faced a not very busy junction, so we could hear the cars, but the windows were so good that the this did not disturb us, although we are extremely sensitive to noise. I assume that the rooms facing the back of the hotel are completely quiet. Very unusual for city hotels: we could not hear a thing from next door. The bath was also modern and simple. The only minor complaint we had was that the maid was really saving on toiletries.On Sunday, there was only one staff attending to the breakfast buffet, so they had troubles filling back the plates. On the following days the service was excellent. The selection is continental/European, so people from the US may miss their rich breakfast.The hotel is not in the heart of the city, which is good. It is not a rip-off and it is quiet. During the day we moved around by metro - one of the best services we have seen in the world. The Rocafort station was just down the block, so within 15 minutes we could be anywhere we wanted in Barcelona. The service stops at midnight, so for returning to the hotel we used to catch a cab, which cost a ridiculous 7-8 euros per ride
