Room, on the side of the hotel, had no view, except another wall, but quiet. Clean hotel, room valeting very good. Excellent free wine reception in evening. Helpful desk when we needed advice. This is an ideal place to spend time in this interesting city. Recommended. Avoided the in-house restaurant after evening meal found expensive and disappointing. Liked the Hollywood Cafe up the road for breakfast: good value, quick and tasty.
