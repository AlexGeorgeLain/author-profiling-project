Location is inside a Local Street Poor alittle, with Some Fruit/Vegtable Markets and 2 small supermarket (incase you want to buy water ). you should consider always haveing the hotel card in ur pocket. Room: Fair Good as i advised, they have free internet but i just knew this when i was leaving as there is not sign saying free internet!!Bathroom is small but enough for a 3 Star hotel, and Beds were fair enough for havin a sleep , Street is quiet @ night. Breakfast: is the worst thing ....its from 7-9, and usually if you got there @ 8 , you will find everything is almost finished ...they dunt re-fill! Anyway, i just spend 3 days so i was not really suffering as most of the time i was out of the room. i just used it for sleeping.
