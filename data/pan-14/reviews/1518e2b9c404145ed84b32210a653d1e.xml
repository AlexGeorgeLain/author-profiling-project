The room, though not large, was beautifully furnished, and we had a small balcony that looked out over the rooftops of Florence. Most lovely. The location is good - 2 blocks from the train station and close to the sites. The staff were generally very helpful. The breakfast was not the best we had in Italy, but more than satisfactory, none the less. Any complaints? Well, the plumbing was a little noisy on occasion, though that was not a constant thing, and it is a very old building. The one small elevator and the equally small lobby created problems for some when several people (with lots of lugage) were trying to check in or out all at once, but it was never a problem for us. We would certainly go back to this hotel again.
