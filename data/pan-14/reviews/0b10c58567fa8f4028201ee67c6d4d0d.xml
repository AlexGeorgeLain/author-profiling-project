Very good staff and friendly. Extra bonus was the free parking on offer as parking in san francisco is very hard to get. Very old typical san francisco hotel which had loads of character, offers free breakfast in the morning too which was very nice. Also if you are in between 4 - 6 pm you get free cherry and biscuits in the lounge. We stayed here for 6 days and enjoyed every minute of it, loads of great restaurants to eat at and plenty of shopping to do too. We went to alcatraz on a night tour which i recommend booking before you go as i gets very busy. Also hired some bikes and did a 16 mile bike ride and caught the ferry back. Had a great six days
