First time staying at Jury's and I chose it based on Trip Advisor reviews. Although a bit pricey - Service was wonderful, they couldn't have done more! We are newspaper addicts and they not only leave the Boston Globe at your door but were happy to send along the New York Times as well. Room was small but quite cozy, bed was heavenly, bathroom lovely. Appreciated the windows that opened and the towel warmers and bathrobes. Although the bar is amazingly loud when you come through the front doors the rooms were quiet as could be! Didn't eat at the restaurant, but then there are so many wonderful restaurants in the area.I would go again, great location!
