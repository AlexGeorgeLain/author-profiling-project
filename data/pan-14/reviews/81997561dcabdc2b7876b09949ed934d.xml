Most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful although on one evening the girls in the bar were very off hand.The rooms are average and didn't really look as though they had been refurbished in fact I would say they were drab. The bathroom was super though. The pool staff were delightful as were the staff in the Italian restaurnat and the food was excellent there too. Would I go back - Probably not. We have been to the Pan Pacific over the road on several occasions and I would deffinately say it is better.
