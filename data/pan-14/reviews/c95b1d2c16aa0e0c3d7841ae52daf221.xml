Porters collected our bags from the car and delivered to the room.The room was a park view and had a lovely view over wynyard park. Room was very clean with a marble bathroom. Walls were very solid and we heard nothing from other rooms during our stay.Concierge was helpful.This hotel provides excellent value for money in one the of the most convenient locations within Sydney - a short walk to the harbour and above Wynyard station.
