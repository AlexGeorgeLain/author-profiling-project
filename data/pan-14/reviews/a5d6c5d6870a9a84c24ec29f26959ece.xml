We stayed there for a cheerleading comp. and they bent over backwards to accommodate us. The front desk staff was very friendly and service is very quick. We called down for towels and they had them to our room within 5 mins., may have been less then that. The hotel was conveniently located to where ever we needed to go. The rooms were perfect for what we needed, I did not think they were small at all for a hotel. The beds were super comfy which I loved. This is a more upscale hotel so expect the prices to be higher. I would stay here again in the future.
