After hearing such rave reviews of the Laurel Inn from a fellow friend the Laurel Inn became the obvious choice when it came to visiting family in San Francisco. The hotel is a few miles from downtown, but the number one bus stops right in front of the hotel which makes an easy trip downtown or to the wharf. My room on the city side had a nice little kitchenette and a sweeping city view. The beds were really comfy and there was even a septate sitting area with a sofa in the room! The refrigerator came in handy after bringing home the leftovers from Osteria, a great Italian restaurant next store. There is always gourmet coffee in the lobby and a free continental breakfast every morning. This is a small hotel which is staffed 24 hours and all of the staff is very friendly and edger to help you with any of your travel needs. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
