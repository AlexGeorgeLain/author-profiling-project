There was some building work going on to the outside but other than a bit of dust there were no issues with thisThe room itself was immaculately clean and had a very contemporary and well thought out feel. The rain shower was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortableThe location was great, with easy walking access to all the major parts of the city. Would definately stay here again

We arrived early morning having flown 21 hours from the UK and although it was too early to check in we were offered access to a shower to freshen up. The room was a deluxe harbour view with balcony and it was spacious, well designed and equipped and had fabulous views over Darling Harbour and was within a 25 minute walk of The Rocks and Opera House - fantastic!
