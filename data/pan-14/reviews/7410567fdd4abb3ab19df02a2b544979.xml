We selected the Hotel Villa Real based on traveladvisor reviews and we were not disappointed - it was a good choice. The location was quiet (as other reviewers had remarked). The room was large and spacious, with a lower level given over to living (including a comfortable red leather settee and a balcony). Exhausted from our shopping expedition, we dined that night in the hotel restaurant (the more casual one) and had an excellent risotto. We would certainly stay in Hotel Villa Real again.
