The staff are particularly customer aware and friendly. The hotel is well situated to the central CDB and the stroll across Hyde Park each morning and evening was very pleasant . Just a little gtrizzle- the In Room internet charge is too expensive. AUD$29.00 per 24/7. Don't connect- hop round the corner to the Vodafone internet cafe. Very clean and well set out. $2.00 for 30mins. All I needed for checking email etc.Some nice restuarants nearby, Oxford Street has many, but the street is dirty and though I did not feel unsafe, it seems to be the gathering place for the gay and lesbian people and the homeless. The Museum Station ( underground rail) is on opposite corner of Hyde Park and ideal for taking the Airport train to Sydney Airport. $14.00 one way.Would recommend Marriott for visitors wanting centrally located accomodation and adjacent facilities.
