I read a lot of reviews on this website before we left and i was unsure of what to expect. However, we were blown away by the hotel and especially by the staff.The staff on arrival were friendly and exlpained the various rules of the hotel, such as how to get your towels each day and when and were to eat.The room we stayed was in great condition and thankfully there was air conditioning. There is a mini bar with bottled water, soft drinks and alcohol which was restocked everyother day. They also have a safe in each room.The pool is okay but we found that, because of the palm trees, there was not much breeze so it got very hot around that area. Still, its great to have the waiter come round and take your drink order whilst your soaking up the rays!We spent most of our time on the beach, which is fantastic. The sea is clear and very clean. The only problem was you got a lot of people approaching you to try and get you to go parasailing/scuba diving etc.ALL the staff were excellent, they do anything to help you and a big shout out goes to Rafael, our waiter in the main resturant. Most of them speak fairly good english but i does help if you know some basic spanish.The food is good but got a bit samey towards the end of our stay. Im pleased to say the we did not suffer any illness nor did anyone else that we knew of.The only negative we could find is that there isnt much entertainment in the evenings but you are free to go into the other hotels in the resort to find some.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and came back alot more relaxed than when we left. Enjoy your stay !
