Bedroom and particularly bathroom were spotless, and the room itself was spacious and quiet. Didn't eat any food at the hotel during our stay but the menu looked good! 2 minute walk from the underground station, and plenty of taxis right outside the hotel should you need one. The only thing that made this a 4 rather than 5 star review is the desk staff being not particularly friendly. They weren't rude or unhelpful, just a smile would be nice when welcoming guests to your hotel!
