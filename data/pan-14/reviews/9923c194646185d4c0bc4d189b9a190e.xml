Our room was small, but well appointed and clean. The breakfast in the courtyard was delightful. Walter and Sandro were very helpful in making recommendations for restaurants and even called to reserve a table for us at a popular restaurant. The neighborhood is out of the major tourist areas, but is still within a comfortable walking distance to all the sights. Many of the bars and restaurants in this area are wonderful because they are local places (i.e. no tourist menus)I highly recommend!
