CleanHelpfull staffnice restaurantSpacious RoomsThe Not so Good (not neccisarily bad though!):Facilities lacking (although comparing to UK hotels more then other Syndey hotels so please compare carefully)...I.e swimming pool, small gym, thats about it no spa, no steam room/sauna none of that.. Internet costs another $30 per day (although for 3 min walk to harbourside shops there is a cafe for $3 for an hour!)and breakfast wasn't included in my package- another $30 each.summary:good location and can be got for a good price of lastminute (is a secret hotel!) has everything you need, but if you want the little extras you have to pay. clean and friendly staff so overall not a bad experiance!
