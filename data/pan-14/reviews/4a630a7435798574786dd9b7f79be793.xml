Although I stayed in one of the standard rooms, Saraswati, it was clean, comfortable, spacious, and had everything I needed. Water pressure was dodgy in the shower, but this is fairly common, and probably worse in upstairs rooms. The gardens are beautiful, and it's worth booking an upstairs room so you can lie on the day bed and look over the trees and flowers to Mt Agung. The staff are caring and considerate and do everything they can to make your stay a pleasant one. The real bonus is to have a car 'on call' for whenever you want to go in to Ubud, or be picked up after shopping or eating in town. It's an easy walk to Ubud beside the Monkey Forest, but when you reach Monkey Forest Road it's a bit of a slog and I'd recommend going via Jalan Hanoman. There's no restaurant at Alam Shanti but you can order food to be delivered from restaurants, and there is always the car to drop you and pick you up from any restaurant in Ubud. After six trips to Bali, and staying in a wide range of accommodation, I feel that Alam Shanti combines the best elements of a Bali experience - natural beauty, gentle people and a serene atmosphere. And there's the lovely pool to enjoy if the tropical heat is too much!
