We were given a room in the front of the hotel, facing a frontage road, next to a major freeway. The traffic noise didn't stop all night. Plus, the room was next to the elevator and the vending machines. This is a quiet room?!At checkout, another guest was complaining because the toilet in their room didn't work, and they had to go to the lobby to use the restroom. They had complained, someone fixed it, and it didn't work all night. Plus, there was a boom box blasting in the room next to them which they complained about, and management did nothing to help them.Don't even consider staying at this place. Drive right by.
