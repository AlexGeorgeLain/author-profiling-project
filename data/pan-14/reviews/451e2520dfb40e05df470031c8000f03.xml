The bedroom and facilities were also very comfortable.However our initial thoughts soon turned to disappointment on the next morning when, having been told that you are not allowed to reserve pool chairs, that all of the pool chairs with shade had been reserved with towels.(They were already reserved by 7.30am!) When we queried this we were rudely told by the pool staff that those people were around, but as we could see only 5 people in the pool and 30 chairs reserved we argued the point, only to be told that it is hotel policy not to reserve chairs. It all became apparent what was going on when we saw money change hands to a pool attendant from two guests who had 4 sunbeds, two chairs, a table and shade reserved! So therefore double standards exist as it is apparent that if you pay the pool attendants some money that you can indeed reserve as many chairs as you want. We advised the management accordingly who said that they would look into the matter.Further to this we do not find acceptable in a hotel of this standard a wait of 45 (yes 45) minutes for breakfast at House without a key. There were many empty tables so I do not understand why there was any wait at all. We decided to go at 10.30 to the buffet brunch at Orchids instead - only to be told that no seating was available until 2pm.Outside people come into the hotel for breakfast and there is no priority for paying guests. Management are aware of the problem but are not prepared to do anything about it. If we had known this we definitely would not have taken the sunrise package which includes breakfast.NOT 5 STAR SERVICE EXPECTED FOR THE PRICEWe will definitely not be returning.
