The hotel is very new, and the service still needs to smooth off some rough edges (mostly in the language department) but our experience overall was terrific. We had a big and beaufifully decorated room with all sorts of special touches (including free internet -- too many hotels of this grade charge 15-25$). The breakfast buffet was lavish and delicious. The fitness center was splendid and the pool was a delight -- sooo big. Also, the hotel's location is very central. Overall, a marvellous place to stay in Beijing.

The location in a quiet residential neighborhood was great for us, as it gives a different view of SF than the usual downtown one, but it could be inconvenient for some travellers. The rooms were unusually large for a city hotel, and very comfortable, with a pleasant and muted W-ish decor. Our first room had a small kitchenette, the second did not -- here, a micro wave and a small fridge would have been welcome. The front desk staff was very helpful and very welcoming, to us and to our standard poodle. The parking was great. And the price was very reasonable, considering the quality of the place. We would recommend the Laurel enthusiastically to our friends, unless they need to be downtown.
