After finding this one, having advertised 24 hr shuttle bus via their website, we chose this one so we could have everything lined up for our evening. Disappointed that they cut off service at 10:30PM, after arriving at the DAL Lovefield airport at 11:30, we ended up having to get a taxi. No complimentary breakfast as stated via the website.No complimentary newspaper, even though one was left in front of other doors, just not ours.Bathroom fan didn't work, leaving the room slimy after a nice refreshing shower.Rude staff working front desk, would not assist with making any shuttle arrangements for the next morning, was told we would have to get to the shuttle desk at 6AM to make any arrangements.
