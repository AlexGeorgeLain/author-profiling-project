The hotel had a very convenient parking garage attached for $18 a night. You need to get your parking ticket validated by the hotel before leaving. The check in process was quick and we got to our room within 5 minutes. Overall the room and bathroom were clean and updated. However, the AC/Heat element-vent was dirty and old, was from the 1970s complete with dust and grime. (This grosses me out at any place) The room was very tight for 2 Queen beds one bed was pushed up against the dirty AC thing. Less then desirable but oh for most older hotels. We had dinner at the restaurant. The menu was diverse and all price ranges. The bartender made some good drinks for us. The waitress was EXTREMELY the food was good. There was a small food court with fast food and coffee shops and CVS. The hotel was quiet for a few hours sleep. The checkout process was quick and we were at the hospital within 10 minutes. recommend this place if you are traveling from out of town or local and have an early morning appointment at one of the hospitals.
