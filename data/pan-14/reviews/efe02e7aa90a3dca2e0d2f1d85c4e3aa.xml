This is a terrific hotel centrally located in Midtown next to the Ziegfeld Theater and several blocks from the Park. Our room was spacious and very nicely appointed; it had a sitting room with a divan, chair, and desk, and a separate bedroom with a king bed and huge bathroom with a double shower. Both rooms had flat panel televisions and wireless internet. We found the bed to be very comfortable with super soft sheets and the room itself was extremely quiet for NYC; we were on the 27th for. The towels and toiletries were very nice as well.Enjoyed a meal downstairs at Maze one evening. It's a lively place with attentive servers and delicious tapas sized offerings. We did not reserve far enough in advance to be accommodated at the Gordon Ramsey, which, according to several people who have dined there, is like no other place on earth!
