We were Starwood guests on points. We highly recommend staying at the Palace and would love to return, especially if we didn't have to pay over 800 euros to do so. We ate breakfast out nearby, including VIPs around the corner, next to Starbucks. I preferred places in Santa Anna square or on way up the hill there. Also went there for Tapas. Prado is practically across the street. There is a wonderful carillon next door which plays frequently, looks old, but apparently, not.
