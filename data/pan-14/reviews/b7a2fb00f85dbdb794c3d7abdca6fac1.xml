It's a short walk from the train station, although ongoing construction made it a bit longer. The lobby is pleasant, the dining room (breakfast included) is lovely, and the rooms are spacious by Italian standards: comfortable, clean and well-appointed. The desk clerks speak reasonably good English and are pleasant and helpful if you have questions. I really can't fault the Alba in any way. You can walk to the Duomo in about 10 minutes, and some fine restaurants (I recommend Buco Mario) are within 5 minutes. The complementary breakfast is nice enough; the usual assortment of croissants, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee sweet rolls. No hesitation recommending the Alba, even for pickier travelers.
