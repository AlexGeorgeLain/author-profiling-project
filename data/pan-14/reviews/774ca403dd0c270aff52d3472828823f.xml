I noticed that some of the reviews were not so good...but I have to tell you....to us and what we had just gone through with our ending trip....this place was Heaven! I think that bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Fortunately the hotel has a resturant and we arrived at the hotel about 11pm, all 70 or so of us displaced passengers, and we bombarded the resturant...no problem...everyone was served with a smile. The location is extremely convenient to the airport, and the shuttle is helpful too.I did not notice any airport noise during our stay and our room was very clean, neat and updated. We would stay here again.
