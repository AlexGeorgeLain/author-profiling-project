Bathroom was nice and fairly sizeable. Flatscreen TV comfortable bed.Location: Great for shows at the Citi/ Wang Center as it is right accross the street. Lots of restaurants in the area plus China Town a few blocks away. Subway about a 3 minute walk. Lots of clubs in the area which was annoying to us. TIP: On a Saturday night it was REALLY loud. Maybe with a room in the back it would have been better.
