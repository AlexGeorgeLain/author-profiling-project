It had only been open 6 weeks and so there were some minor teething troubles such as the TV internet facilities not working. Bedroom very comfortable but the duvet was heavy and it was too hot to sleep - there were no alternative bed coverings available. Also the pillows whilst being of the highest quality were too thick for my liking. The aircon was difficult to work out as there were no temperature markings and it was not possible to open the window only a little.The bathroom was very luxurious but the towels did not smell that fresh. The decor of the hotel is minimalist and beautifully colour coordinated. We had dinner in the dining room with guests and although the 'italian' food was of a very high standard, we were surprised to be charge over 80 euros for 7 bottles of mineral water! Breakfast is charged extra and you can help yourself from the buffet for 19 euros or have cooked stuff as well for 26 euros. Fantastic buffet of best quality cheese, meat, salmon, breads, cakes, fresh berries, cereals, juices etc. We did not use the spa but the water in the pool was warm.Good location in beautiful building with helpful staff.
