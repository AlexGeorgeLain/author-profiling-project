After reading reviews on Trip Advisor and after finding a special internet rate, I decided to book the Prince Conti even though I was leary of the hotel because of such a great rate in such a good location. However, when we arrived in New Orleans, I was very impressed with the hotel and their staff. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful and the rooms were very nice and clean. The ONLY problem I had was that the room we got did not have a window and I am very claustrophobic. However, I was not ever bothered by it. The hotel was very quiet and it was 1/2 block from Bourbon Street, which was great. When you are on Bourbon Street drinking, it's great to be able to walk to your room anytime you want to use the restroom and take a break. :) I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when it reopens.
