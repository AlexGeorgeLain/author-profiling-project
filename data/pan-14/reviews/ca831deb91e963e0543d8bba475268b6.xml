The staff was knowledgeable and attentive and the location was great. We upgraded our room and had a view of the Eiffel Tower out one window and the Arc de Triumph out the other window. Hotel was very close to one of the main Metro stations so getting around was simple. Clean room was well appointed and bigger than I expected it to be. Would recommend to all and will stay there again the next trip to Paris
