The reserve at Los Cabezas de San Juan which includes the Fajardo Lighthouse has the most spectacular views in all the island. However, you must make reservations to join the tour and this is where the difficulty comes in. Their reservations # will bring you around in voicemail circles with no way out. Nancy personally made our reservations for us. She also arranged a last minute tour of the Nearby Bio Bay after calling around (no simple thing as these tours are limited and usually sold out on the weekends in high season).The Inn itself is a bit funky and oddly furnished, but very reasonable and clean.Thank you Nancy!
