THe Biltmore still has the old world charm of a real resort. You truly dont need to leave the property,as Pheonix itself is not much to write home about. I stayed in a golf view Villa room that was tastfully decorated, a very comfy bed and a great view of the cascading golf course.The main pool was a little crowded for my taste, but there are 8 pools on the grounds so there is a pool for everyone.Room service was speedy and actually delicious, (beef medallion quasidilla was the best!)There is plenty of shopping, a Lilly Pulitzer store, so I was in heaven, and a starbucks, 2x the price of a regular- non resort starbucks!All and all it was a great stay, and upon check out, booked my next trip for June.
