Rooms were ok, basic but with a sink and mirror, we had a shared shower which was ok, ive been in worse halls of resisdence and some did have en-suite. Staff were very friendly, with the attitude of 'do what you like, just clear up afterwards' and you were always greeted in the morning with 'would you like schum eggsh?Free internet access, a pool table and beer vending machine made it all quite livable. Its in a good location, about 20mins from dam square in a safe neighbourhood, with some nice resturants and bars close by.For a night, I wouldnt stay anywhere else.
