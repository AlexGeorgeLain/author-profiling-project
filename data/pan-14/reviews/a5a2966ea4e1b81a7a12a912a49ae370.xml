Gym not too overcrowded and really nice for hotel gym. Pool has these great cabanas - the only complaint was that it was a bit crowded. Wished I had time to go to the spa but was out and about too much.Really nice location and although valet always expensive in LA - you pay per day so can come and go as you please.Would definately stay here again!
