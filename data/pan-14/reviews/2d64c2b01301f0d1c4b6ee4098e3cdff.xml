Rooms are on the small side but beautifully decorated, furnished, comfortable and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful, and you are just a few steps away from Union Square and some great shopping. Bearing in mind all of this, prices are excellent value. So many hotels in San Francisco are disappointing, noisy and smelly (in my experience) this is great, wouldnt hesitate to recommend it!
