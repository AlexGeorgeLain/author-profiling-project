From the moment our taxi pulled up at the door the staff couldn't have been more helpful (and we did have a lot of bags).We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel - furnished in very modern style and with jacuzzi bath (lovely after our cramped shower on the Emerald Princess). Bathrobes were supplied but we didn't use them. One little complaint...the bath was rather slippery and we would have welcomed a bath mat when showering. The hotel is ideally situated right on La Rambla and very near Catalunya Place and a very central spot e.g. for catching the turistic bus which circumnavigates all the main attractions in the city - both routes, north and south are highly recommended. The staff were very helpful in suggesting good eating places...great recommendations for tapas. We ate breakfast both mornings ( 9 euros per person and well worth it). We would certainly stay at the Monte Carlo again.
