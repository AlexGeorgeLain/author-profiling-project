The point that we missed was that there wasn't a swimming pool, but I think when they would have a swimming pool this hotel certainly would get a 5 star. And would be more expensive.The hotel has a very good orientation, near plaza catalunya and Ramblas so the shopping area. The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms were always okay.The hotel even maid our trip to cava freixenet, they have made the booking for us (group of 7)The triple room was bigger then we thought.Overal a good hotel, and I have read that many persons complain about the noise, but you have to remind that you make a citytrip, and a city where is much to do, there is more noice. But I have nothing noticed at all, and had a quiet sleep!
