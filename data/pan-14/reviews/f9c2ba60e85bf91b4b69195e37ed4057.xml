The room was spacious, but staff was mediocre. Because of a flight delay, I arrived later than I expected and they had canceled my reservation (even though I pre-paid). It took almost an hour to get it resolved.My biggest problem was that the hotel is quite a distance from any restaurant or attraction. It's a bit of a walk to the tram and metro stations, and several minutes to get anywhere from there.

One of the other reviews alluded to thin walls, but the single rooms on the first floor have concrete walls that made the room extra quiet. Be ready though, the single room is about 3 meters by 4 meters (9 x 12 feet), smaller than my college dorm.Breakfast was decent, not terrific.The location was perfect for me -- walking distance to Leidsplein and 100 meters from the 2 and 5 tram stop.All of the staff were very helpful, even at 23:00! I'd stay there again, but they don't have availability...
