Lovely rooms, great outdoor terrace, dogs and cat friendly. Sabina's recommends made the trip great - we ate in the nearby Osteria and the 'Piccaddilly' Pizza place nearby. We will definately be going back!Mick and Lorrie Marchington

The check-in desk people and bell help were both great, and it was good to have tea and coffee. The room was smaller than the Hilton, but comfortable.However, the waitress in the restaurant for breakfast was extremely officious and and the concierge was no help at all - she seemed to just want us to go away. this we did and went back to use the wonderful concierge service in the Hilton from which we had just moved.Overall, we preferred the Hilton.

The rooms were large and comfortable with coffee maker in the room. The concierge service was the best we have experienced anywhere (esp Patti) and they made such a difference to our stay advising on best restaurants etc.
