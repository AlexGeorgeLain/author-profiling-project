It was in March when my partner and I stayed at the Padma and is a late review, but I needed to share what a wonderful time we had at the Padma.The Padma is a beautiful hotel and we were greeted with such warmth when we arrived. We stayed in a Superior room which was decent size and the bathroom super clean. The hotel gardens and landscape are well taken care of and everywhere we went the staff were so friendly. On one particular occasion, I left my necklace on our floor and when we came back to our room after it had been cleaned, my necklace was on our bed in the shape of a heart with a flower in it small but thoughtful idea. The pool is fantastic and the swim up bar even better! We spent most of the day sitting by the pool and you are even given a flag which you raise when you want service even have to move the whole day to get anything!!!! This was luxury for us as we have never been waited on so much before!!The breakfast was amazing everyday and we had Teppanyaki one night at the Japanese restaurant which the chef put on such a good show!!I would recommend the Padma to anyone who is looking to be looked after while on holidays! A trip to remember!!
