The hotel is in a very convenient location, easy walking to all the Fisherman's Wharf attractions. It's also very close to the several cable car stops and has a taxi waiting area right across the street. We had a fair sized king room on the fourth floor with a king sized bed. The room was clean and comfortable but with no view. The hectic complimentary buffet breakfasts were convenient but they were often slow replenishing items that were finished. Front desk service was friendly and helpful. Price could have been a little lower but overall a perfectly fine stay.
