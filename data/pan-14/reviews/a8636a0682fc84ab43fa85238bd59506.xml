Our three rooms were on the low end, price-wise, and a bit smaller than some others we saw. But they were perfectly adequate.Everyone on the staff went above and beyond to help us with the usual tourist questions, suggesting restaurants and making reservations, and immediately getting us whatever we needed for our rooms. They pointed out the grocery store with a deli just down the street, which was nice for picking up beer and snacks for a respite on the patio outside our rooms.Arrive early enough, and you can get a parking space in the hotel lot, which is a real plus in NO.Our only complaints would be that the pillows were too high/big and sometimes the hot water was slow in arriving (typical of an older building).We would return here!
