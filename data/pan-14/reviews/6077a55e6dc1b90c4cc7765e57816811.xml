A wonderful hotel with excellent location, bang opp. the Central Station, very helpful if you want to use frankfurt as a base to visit the nearby areas. The hotel was spotless, had a great breakfast, helpful staff who think of everything. They even have a pool of umbrellas one can borrow on a rainy day, very helpful for travelers. Stayed at the single room, which a bit small but has all you amenities you can think of, including a nice shower.This place gets full fast esp. during Fair shows, so book early. Could not get a room there when I went in Oct last year. Will surely be on my list for my future trips.
