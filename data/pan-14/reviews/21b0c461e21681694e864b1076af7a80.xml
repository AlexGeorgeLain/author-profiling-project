We had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and can only add that they were accurate. The Stellar is a very well appointed small boutique hotel. Centrally located - we could walk downtown Sydney in 20 minutes. Near bus stops, walking distance to railway station (train to airport) and restaurants. The rooms are spacious with kitchenette which we didn't need, but it would be a good feature for someone staying longer. The bathroom were all marble and tiles and quite large. The room and bathroom were very clean and new looking. The staff was very helpful and courteous. There is a locker room off the Lobby for storing luggage, if needed and reasonably priced internet access in the Lobby. A small cafeteria adjacent to the Lobby (not own by the hotel) was excellent for a light breakfast. Lovely, very reasonably priced, small hotel that we would recommend highly. A winner in a city that is rather expensive otherwise.

This hotel is very convenient to the airport. It's comfortable and has a first class, reasonably priced shuttle service to the international terminal. Highly recommended for anyone needing accommodation near the airport.
