(as is also the case in many other countries). i think our children also need to realize how other parts of the world live and appreciate all the things they take for granted, as well as learn of other cultures. all this aside, i want to say that i cannot believe all the negative i have read on this hotel in particular. when we arrived, we were met by our travel agency guide (noel from turinter company)... he spent well over an hour telling us of things to do, got us a welcome drink, spoke to and arranged our check-in with the front desk personnel--he was beyond wonderful to us and made us feel so welcome . he also even placed calls to the USA for my daughter, as we speak no spanish. we were then taken to our rooms, and when my daughter friend went to their room, they walked in on a couple already assigned to that room. fortunately, they were getting ready to go to dinner, so no harm done ! we went to the desk and they immediately assigned them to another room down the hall.... OK, it was an inconvenience, but the people were super about it even talked to us every day after that, and the desk profusely apologized. mistakes happen, and yes, we could have let it ruin our trip, but we chose to overlook it, go on and enjoy our trip. from that point on, i could only walk around in total amazement at the well kept grounds, the warmth we felt from all the staff, the food and food displays, the ammenities, the beach pool areas, etc. i am a very picky eater, and can honestly say that we always found more than enough that was satisfactory to us. granted, there were things on the buffet that were not our choice, but we were not the only people there ! we did not drink the tap water, and had no problem with getting sick. we tried several times to make reservations to go to the specialty restaurants, but it never happened, so no big deal, we will do that another time !! i am not sure where these people writing bad reviews stayed, but i cannot believe that it is the same place we were at. we have a place in cancun that we love usually vacation at, but opted not to this year. we thought we would never find a place that we would love more, but i think we have found that place in DR. please consider that everyone's expectations are different, and if you expecte a 5*, americanized hotel, all american food, do yourself the DR a favor stay home ! our maids were super... we left gifts and tips for them every day, and always had a clean room, towels, extra water, and they were so appreciative of what we left them (nail polish, bracelets, cosmetics, a couple dollars, a small purse, perfume chocolate candy.) i left a couple things each day. .... (we took school supplies for the schools, but school was out, so we passed the stuff on to the staff that had children, as well as some of the people at the market next to the resort). the last morning we were there, our maid came to our door with 2 coconuts drilled at the top with a straw, so you could drink the coconut milk and flowers coming out of the top, with a note written on the side thanking us for everything... it was very sweet !! i hope you think about what you expect, then go and enjoy yourself. we could not have asked for a better trip and experience, and will definitely go back . the only thing i personally think this hotel could do better with is their choice of drinks....... i do not drink beer, and after the first day, the pina coladas and banana mamas got to be too much sweet for me. i would have been in heaven if i could have had a kaluha and cream, but Oh well, i didn't, so no big deal. it would also be nice if there was bottled water available in other places besides just your room, but again, you can't have every thing, and i would still go back in a heart beat !!
