Much to my suprise my room was ready.The room was spacious with a flat screen multi channel tv.The bath large and had a nice kit. Towels were soft with a gant de bain. I had a garden room so there was not street noise.The location was excellent (Ramblas). I got tour bus tickets at the desk and it was a short walk to the bus stop. The tour bus line lets you on and off as often as you like at points of interest.Great restaurants are nearby.
