Check in was a breeze - the desk clerk was courteous, efficient and accomodating. We were given a room in the Tower section with a gorgeous view of the bay. The room was spacious and well furnished, the bathroom was all marble, with a seperate shower and toilet area. The lobby is stunning. Breakfast buffet was expensive at $25, but great variety. The hotel is at the top of Nob Hill - it's quite a steep hike to get there, but cabs are cheap and the cablecar stops right outside. I highly recommend this hotel.
