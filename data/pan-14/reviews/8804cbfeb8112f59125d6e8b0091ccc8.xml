Hotel rates in NYC are expensive, so I was looking for a hotel that gave the best value and had good ratings. Casablanca definitely filled the bill. The staff was wonderful, they couldn't do enough for us. Made sure we had a room facing the courtyard that was quiet, helped us with directions and restaurant suggestions and made us feel really welcome. The 2nd floor lounge is very comfortable, with a generous breakfast, wine and cheese in the early evening and snacks always out at other times. It also has a computer with an internet connection and a printer which was very convenient. The location is half a block from Times Square and close to the Theater district. Yet the hotel is an oasis of calm - when you walk in the door it is quiet and cozy. The room was very nice and the bathroom was great - good size and wonderful shower with great water pressure. The bedding featured soft sheets, down pillows and comforter, very luxurious. Will definitely stay here again.
