On the way a youth tried to grab my wife's backpack-luckily he failed but the experience was very unpleasant. The wonderful reception staff told us Barcelona is a very dangerous city but they kindly upgraded us to a suite.The hotel reception is below street level and there is a lift down from the street but it never worked for us.Breakfast is good value.One gripe-my visa card had to be swipped on 3 different occasions at reception-check out took ages.I feel this hotel is best suited to business types with self defense skills!!
