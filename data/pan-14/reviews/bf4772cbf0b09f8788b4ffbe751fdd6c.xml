We requested a view and were given a lovely corner room with two double beds, two windows and plenty of space. The room was cleaned every day, and we never had any problems with feeling too cold or too hot. The shower was fantastic, the hot water didn't run out, and the kitchenette was handy. In spite of being located next to the service elevator we weren't disturbed and were generally very satisfied. The staff were helpful, polite and friendly and were happy to give local advice when asked. Breakfast was very nice, although as with most hotels quite expensive. I don't understand how anyone could complain about this hotel - obviously it's not a 5 star hotel, but it's nonetheless very comfortable. I've stayed in far more expensive hotels that weren't a patch on it. English people will find it similar to a Holiday Inn type hotel. The best way I can endorse the hotel is to say that next time we visit New York we'll definitely stay at The Belvedere again!
