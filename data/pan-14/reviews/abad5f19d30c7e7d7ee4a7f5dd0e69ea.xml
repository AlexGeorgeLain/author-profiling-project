(Convention in town) Not sure where the negative review came from, but we were very pleased with the Eliot. No, there was no view from the room but an alleyway, but hey! the hotel is on Commonwealth Ave in the city and was not designed for the view...Room was very clean, service was outstanding and everyone we encountered was extremely pleasant and unfailingly helpful. We would definitely stay again.
