We, also, loved the location and friendly staff. We stayed in Room 16 for 99 euros a night, We agree with other reviewers that this room had no view at all and was on the warm side, but the ceiling fan made sleeping comfortable. Our bathroom with shower had been modernized, with plenty of hot water and towels. There was a small, inconveniently located closet and no dresser. If your suitcases are huge, you may have a problem storing them, as the room is on the small side. The big advantage to being on the floor above the lobby is you can use the stairs and don't have to always be waiting for the elevator.The lobby is really more like a cozy living room. The dining room is off the lobby toward the back of the building. For 10 euros you get cereal, juice, croissants, yogurt, coffee. A bit pricey, so we always ate our Continental breakfast elsewhere.Be sure to make reservations at least one day at Elle Pre Verre, directly across the street from the hotel. Wonderful meals, reasonably priced!!
