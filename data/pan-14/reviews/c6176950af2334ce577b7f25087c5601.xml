Weather was very wet and windy but didn't stop us getting around and seeing the sights - Anne Frank house a must see but be sure you have a good map to find your way around on foot. If you like a good steak try the Grasshopper Steakhouse/Restaurant down from Dam Square near the station, lovely Dutch pancake cafe just by the flower market should be visited. For a good laugh visit to Madam Taussaud's - well worth it.
