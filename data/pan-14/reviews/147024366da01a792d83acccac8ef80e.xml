It even had a fridge and microwave.You really don't need to look any further for New York accommodation at a competitive price and I would recommend this hotel without reservation.Incidentally, it is easy to get to from JFK. Take the Airtrain to Jamaica Centre and then the E to 50th Street. The Belvedere is very close by and I hope you enjoy the hotel and NY as much as we have just done.
