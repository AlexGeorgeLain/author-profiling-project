The hotel is located near the Espanya Metro stop, the Bullfighting Ring and the Pillars of Parliament. We were also within walking distance of a fabulous dinner Flamenco Show at Spanish Town.Things we liked: personable helpful staff, hotel location central to the metro, bountiful breakfast, lots of storage space for personal items in the bathroom, lots of little stores, tapas bars and restaurants nearby.Things we didn't like: Eery green neon hallways, rock-hard bed (like sleeping on a box-spring!), dark purple out-of-scale furniture and decorations that made the room feel dark and oppressive, noisy garbage trucks at 3:30 am, boisterous people out on the streets at 5 am.We were traveling to three countries over five weeks. This was among our least favorite hotels. The location could not be beat, but we would probably look for a different hotel in the same vicinity if we were to stay in Barcelona again.
