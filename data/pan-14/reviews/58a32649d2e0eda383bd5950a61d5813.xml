The following 4 paid nights had been booked for a one bedroom but the hotel kindly let us stay in the 2 bedroom suite. Nice touch. Very nice breakfast spread each morning and Mon-Thurs they put on a light meal/beverage( wine beer) service. We found it to be very satisfactory for our evening meal. Even though it was close to Miami airport, we barely noticed any noise. The adjacent Dolphin Expressway takes you right out to Miami Beach, but we found it somewhat congested one afternoon rush hour coming back to the hotel.Excellent, well-managed property- I'd certainly stay there again.
