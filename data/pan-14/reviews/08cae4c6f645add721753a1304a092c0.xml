The rooms are small but adequate and, like the rest of the hotel, spotlessly clean. For us, the best points were the central location in a quiet street, the excellent breakfast and the friendly staff.Our room was at the back of the hotel, with a tiny window and no views but the compensation was the quietness, apart from some inconsiderate corridor noise. We had no problems with the bathroom which actually had a (very welcome) bath in it.Our favourite place to eat was the Museo del Jamon in Calle Mayor, where you can stand at the counter with the crowd of locals and have a drink and a sandwich or eat a hot meal upstairs in the equally packed cafeteria. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.For a full restaurant meal, try La Vaquita Argentina, tucked in a corner of the Opera square - especially good for carnivores.If you fancy a change from standard Spanish beer, Naturbier in Plaza Santa Ana brew their own German style cloudy lager. Ask for a tostada and you will get a dark version. Very tasty.The Tourist Office in Plaza Mayor do a selection of guided walks in English, lasting about an hour for around 4 Euros. We did a couple and found them very good value.Room Mate Mario is a great hotel - book it now.
