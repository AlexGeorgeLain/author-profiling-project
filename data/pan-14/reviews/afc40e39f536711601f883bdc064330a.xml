We felt very safe with the locked elevator entrance. Our room was very pretty and comfortable. We had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge out our window. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was handy to public transportation. There were nice restaurants within easy walking distance. We wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else upon a return trip to San Francisco.
