The staff at Hotel Royal Magda helped make that experience even more special. They were always helpful with direction or diner recommendation. The hotel itself was clean and well maintained. It is very cozy which we did not mind since we spent most of our time exploring Paris. We were only a few blocks from a centralized Metro station directly under the Arc de Triomphe. When our daughter is a little older we will definitely come back. Thank You Flore!
