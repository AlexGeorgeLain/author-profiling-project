On arrival I was told that the room I had booked was not available and that I had been upgraded to an executive room but with twin beds instead of a kingsize bed which would be replaced the next day. However after arriving back to hotel after a day of touring the twin beds had not been exchanged for kingsize bed as previously promised. We rang reception and had to change rooms to one with king size bed.Also the kettle fused the electrics twice and we had to have a new kettle delivered to ensure no further power failiures.The price of the mini bar is over priced and the cost for making phonecalls is quite steep too. We rang Macau (only one hour away) and were charged 50 HKD for a very short call.Staff are friendly enough, but don't see why so many people seem to go overboard with there praise for this hotel. It's just an ok hotel and I presonally would rate it 4 star rather than 5.Also Mongkok MTR is not on the island line so usually requires transfers to get to the main places.Jason Wallace
