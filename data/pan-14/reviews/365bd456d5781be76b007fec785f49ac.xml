When we arrived we found the staff less than welcoming. And the room we were assigned did not match any of our stated needs ( i.e. a cot) and preferences( e.g. high floor, extra pillows, etc.). When I called the front desk to inquire about the cot we had requested I was informed that they do not have cots. I was told to use the sofa bed ( the usual thin mattress over loose wire mesh) , and to make the bed myself with the sheets and blankets in the closet.Unlike most Residence Inn hotels I have stayed at, the decor and furniture looked cheap and dated.We had been looking forward to our stay as a place to relax in our way to our destination. But what we found was not what we were led to believe during the reservation process.I cancelled our reservation for the return leg and stayed at a hotel in Terminal 3. Much better.
