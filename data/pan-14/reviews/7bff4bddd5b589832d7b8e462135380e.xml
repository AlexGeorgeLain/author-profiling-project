Greg at the front desk is a great source of information. WIFI is now available in the lobby. Nothing fancy, but good for a resting place after a long day of sightseeing. The pool and hot tub was wonderful.

It was so small 2 people could not meet, the bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen and when you open the window curtain you stare right into a blank wall, about 10 ft. away. I dont know if this is the way they get you to ask for an upgrade. Well, I did and asked for ocean view. After some looking they found it and told me that it would be an additional $ 200 for a 7 day stay. That was OK, so I initialled it. They assigned us the penthouse on the 18th floor. Great rooms and wonderful view. The surprise came at check-out time. The $ 200 was the charge per night, so I owed an additional $ 1400. After some discussion with the manager she waltzed around and finally dropped it to $ 100/night. I did not ask for the penthouse, just a ocean front room. I feel that this was a bait and switch plan. Give them the worst room in the house and then sock it to them. Very unhappy. Food is OK and not too expensive. The front bar is the best, live entertainment, friendly bar keep.Advise: Make sure your room is what you expect. Standard room is nothing as explained. I will never return to this hotel again.
