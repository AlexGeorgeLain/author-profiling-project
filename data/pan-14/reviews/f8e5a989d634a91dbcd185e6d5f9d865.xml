We were delighted with our choice of Hotel Fita. On arrival the owner Hans greeted us with some peach cider and nibbles. A very nice touch. The hotel was in a quiet location,yet handy to trams museums. Our romms were clean, and spacious with a large bathroom , an ironing board iron, tea coffee making facilities , writing desk, and two comfy chairs. Everything a traveller could want. Breakfasts were good, fresh orangeg juice, fruit, cereal, cheeses, toast, and cooked breakfast. Hans was only too happy to give advice on what to do and where to go and our group were very happy with his individual recommendations. Four of us had a late flight home and for an extra fee were were able to secure a room for a late check out. We were given fresh towells, making the prospect of our long haul home to Australia easier.Only imporvementI could suggest: Australians do not like powdered milk in the tea. Fresh is best!
