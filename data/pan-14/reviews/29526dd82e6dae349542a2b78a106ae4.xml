Free Internet access and multi-language TV were nice touches, too.A couple of drawback, which were minor to us, but could be problematic to others:walls were pretty thin; if you're a ligth sleeper, know that you may hear people in other rooms opening closet doors, etc.Showers - ours needed proper caulking - the hotel is new, but already there was minor water damage around teh floor of teh shower (room 221); also, drain was a bti slow.We would recommend this hotel without hesitation - we had a great stay in a centrally-located hotel.
