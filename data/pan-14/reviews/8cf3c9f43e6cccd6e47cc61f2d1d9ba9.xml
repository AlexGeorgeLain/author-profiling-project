Yes, it is small but 'upgrading' to a superior room can help, although that can mean a cost not far off something like the Keio Plaza Hotel.If you need to work west from Tokyo, the Seibu Shinjuku line is right beneath the hotel (and not noisy unless you get a low room). This line is ideal for Tanashi and Tokorozawa towns but gives you the benefit of living in the nightlife of Tokyo.Staff are friendly and speak reasonable English; restaurant is not exactly gourmet but passable and the bar on the top floor is OK and gives a good view.
