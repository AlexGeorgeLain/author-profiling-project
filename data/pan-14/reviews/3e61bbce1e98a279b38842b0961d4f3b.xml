The triple room (room number 14) was in the ground floor of the main building and had both good and negative features. The decoration was nice and the room was clean. However, what was not mentioned anywhere was the not so nice view to the backyard and trashcans. The same backyard was used by a restaurant from the opposite building and the staff had their cigarrette breaks behind our window so we had to keep the drapes closed all the time to avoid feeling like animals in the zoo. Also, they were emptying the trashcans and pouring empty bottles (a lot of them...) from one trashcan to another, which made a lot of noise. According to the hotel staff this never happens before 10 am but during our stay the noise started after 8 am already. So forget about sleeping late in the morning (at least in room 14), it is impossible.Most of the hotel staff was very helpful, first our room was freezing and when we mentioned this, they brought us an extra heater within 5 minutes. Also most of the lampbulbs were broken and it was rather dark in our room (also because we had to keep the drapes closed pretty much all the time), they fixed the bulbs too right after we told them. The quad rooms where in another buildning and they were ok. Definitively better beds and pillows than in the triple room. Free internet. The only little problem with this was an elderly lady who occupied the computer for a whole day to herself.
