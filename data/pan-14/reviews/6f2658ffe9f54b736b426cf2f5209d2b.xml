The staff was friendly and spoke English very well. We looked forward to breakfast every morning and enjoyed the snacks and warm beverages in the lobby. The internet room was a great perk as we checked our e-mail every couple days. The drinks in the mini-bar were another nice perk (O.J./ Beer/ Pepsi/Water). We used Frankfurt as a base for several day trips (Basel, Strausbourg, Wiesbaden, Cologne) so the location right across the street from the south entrance to the Hauptbahnhof was ideal. About 10-15 minute walk to the Main, Romerburg, the Ziel, Stadel etc. We will stay at the Excelsior again.
