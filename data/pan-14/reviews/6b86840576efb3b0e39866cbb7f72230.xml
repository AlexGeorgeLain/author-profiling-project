There are multiple towers, we were in the Kalia Tower on the executive floor which was very nice (we were upgraded for free!). The rooms were exceptional with Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, spacious balconies, and attention paid to detail. Included with executive status is continental breakfast from 8-10 am each morning with a nice selection of fruit, pastries, cereals and an afternoon tea starting at 4pm with snacks (quiche, cookies, veggies, etc). The pools are nice and there is a lagoon as well. The property is on the beach and in the midst of high-end shops. A short 10-15 min walk gets you to Waikiki Beach. There are many restaurant options in the hotel vicinity, though, so you can consider this a complete resort with pool, shopping, spa, and restaurants all on the premises. Aquacylces, kayaks can be rented on the property as well. We had a great vacation here and would recommend it to anyone......
