It was very convenient to walk to the event and we had the option of the monorail door to door. The room was clean, bed comfortable and as we had breakfast, late check out and parking included in the price as well as being able to use our Rydges Priority card - we found this hotel excellent value. The only things that were a bit disappointing was that the fridge and air conditioning were very noisy and you could hear movements and talk from the hall. Nothing from other rooms. Breakfast was excellent. Staff were helpful and I arrived at midday and was able to go directly to the room. For a Sydney Central Hotel - it is great!
