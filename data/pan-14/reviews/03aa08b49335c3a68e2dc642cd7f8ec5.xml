The room isn't very large but it's very comfortable, especially the bed sheets.The only thing I have to object about the room, is the lack of 2 chairs in which 2 people can sit to have breakfast (I ordered room service) together.The room was not at all noisy, I think we might have gotten the partial bay view rooms.When we arrived the room wasn't ready yet and they told us that you would be ready at 3 o'clock. We came in at 3.30 pm but the room was still not ready. However they offered us a drink at the bar until the room was ready (took about half an hour).I especially apreciated the hotel internet service: it has 4 computers with free internet access and a printer, so if you dont't have your laptop with you, you're still able to access internet.The location was great for me has it was close to the financial center and near the BART/muni station. ~However if you plan to shop and you're looking for a more lively area at night you should stay near Union Square (lots of hotels there).
