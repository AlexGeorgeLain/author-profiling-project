Public transportation is right in front of the hotel (S- / U-Bahn, Bus).The hotel itself was completely reimburshed in 2004 and following has a modern style. The staff is very engaged and always offered a helping hand. The quiet room was a little bit small, but ok and had a great view.To sum up, we would book it again for a trip to Berlin!
