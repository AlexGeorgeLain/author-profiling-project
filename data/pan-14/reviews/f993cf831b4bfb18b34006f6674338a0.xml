Elegant design, spotlessly clean, welcoming friendly staff, large room, clean towels every day. Breakfast relaxed (until 11 a.m.) with extensive choice of fruits, cereals, hot and cold meats, eggs, breads and rolls. We really enjoyed our four nights there and would be happy to return in the future.One suggestion - provide a kettle with tea/coffee facilities in the room please (Spanish hotels in general don't seem to do this).
