The underground is just 100 meters away and the light railway not more than 400m. A tourist information office is in an alley next to the hotel. The room was spacious, warm and clean. The noise level was next to zero although the next room was also occupied. The breakfast buffet was quite rich and of good quality. Having visited Berlin just before Christmas, we were pleasantly surprised on the next day after our arrival to run across a Christmas market nearby. Berlin was full of such markets and we had the chance to see it in full Christmas spirit, which was a very nice plus for our trip. For non german-speaking persons, you must get used to the idea that foreign languages do not appear to be the strong point of Germans. Yet, they shall give it a try anyhow.
