It was on Sat.5/5/07, prior to our cruise we were pleasantly surprised. From the reviews I expected something terrible it wasn't. What we expected was loud music a dirty hotel. Our room was quiet the most disgusting thing I saw was soiled carpeting in the room. We came to be outdoors not set in the hotel room. The location was good, especially being near the beautiful lagoon. It is right beside the fancy Caribe Hilton, so you can enjoy there shopping, Starbucks gardens. We opted to not eat at the expensive steakhouse next door. Instead we spoke w/ the cab drivers they directed us to an authentic restaurant. We hopped in a cab were taken to the Hacienda restaurant we walked back. The food was great the view was magnificent. Our restaurant pictures turned out really cool. We also realized after paying $7 per beer at the Caribe, that there is a small store right across the street. At this store you can buy snacks, beer misc. (like a Family Express) We are planning on going back next year. Just don't open your hotel window or the pigeons will try to fly in. Plus take your sunscreen you must see the Forts in Old San Juan.
