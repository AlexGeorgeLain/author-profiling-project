After a 3 week trip through Indonesia we were looking forward to a really nice room for our final night in Singapore and for $180 we thought the place would be fine - WRONG.Either the LP has never stayed at this hotel or Stevie Wonder wrote the review. Room was small, cramped, bathroom not big enough to swing a mouse never mind the cat, no room for storing bags etc.... Breakfast very average and staff not exactly helpful either.As others have stated location is OK for the Quays but better you spend your money away from this place and get the MRT. Extremely Disappointed.
