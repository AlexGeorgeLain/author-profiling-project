From the moment I got there, I felt like I was either in an old folks home or back in the 70's. The place looks old and in need of serious updating!I booked this place cuz I wanted a nice set-off point for my vacation in Hawaii. I had an early flight from SF airport and wanted nice and close to the aiport.It was close to the airport.I booked a room on the club floor -- cuz it claimed to be a nicer room with access to the club floor lounge. The lounge sounds nice until you see it, and it's really just a big hotel room with tacky furniture. It's one saving grace was a computer hooked to the internet. I was hoping for something classier.I'd hate to find out what it's like on the non-club floors.I went down to the bar, and it too was as classy as the rest of the joint. Tacky furnishings in a tacky bar.
