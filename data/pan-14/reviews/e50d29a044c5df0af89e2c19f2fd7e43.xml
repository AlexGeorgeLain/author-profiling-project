We were near the Great Berlin Zoo and the Shopping Street that has so many wonderful shops and Restaurants.We booked a City tour through the Hotel and were picked up at the Hotel and ended our tour nearby. It was a very nice tour of the New Berlin and well narrated with stops at Checkpoint Charlie and The Brandenburg Gate. We were told the History of the new buildings that were rebuilt after the War.The Hotel is very clean, comfortable and quiet and they go out of their way to help with most employee's speaking some English. When we called the Front Desk they answered in English with our Surname which made it easy for us to communicate and anything we ask for we were given immediate attention.The food at the Hotel is excellant and we order a few meals that were not on the menu..If they can accomodate you, they will..We had a wonderful stay at this Hotel.Janice and Richard Stewart
