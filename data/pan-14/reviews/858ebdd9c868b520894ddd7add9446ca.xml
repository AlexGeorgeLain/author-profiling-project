It is on a very busy street so you do hear a lot of traffic noise during the day, although at night it's not that bad. The location can't be beat if you want to be close to shopping, Chinatown, Union Square, and public transportation. My room was small, clean if you don't look to hard, and freshly painted. It had a clawfoot bathtub and a view down to the shops on Grant Street. As long as you are not expecting anything more than a reasonably clean, safe hotel with basic accomodations that's not fancy, you will not be disappointed here. In this price range, it's better than the majority. For the right price, I would not hesitate to stay here again.
