The hotel is situated in a quiet street away from all the bustle but a short distance from all the main tourist attractions. The rooms are small , however the standard of cleanliness throughout the hotel is excellent, the breakfast whilst expensive was very good, breakfast staff was friendly and helpful.I sampled the wine from the bar on a couple of occassions as the weather was bad,again it was good.
