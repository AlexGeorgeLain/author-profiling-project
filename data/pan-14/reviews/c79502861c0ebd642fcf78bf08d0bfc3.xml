The room is perfectly designed, plasma on the wall and smaller tv in granite bathroom. A walk in closet is big ehough for 2 king size cases. Room service arrives in 11 minutes, 2 waiters roll a trolley of perfectly prepared food in and arrange us in no time. The beer is cold. At night we eat in the 52 floor restaurant. good food, a inferior lady jazz singer wails away. The top floor pool has great views but a very powerful smell of chlorine has us both retching, gasping for clean air. A great experience in a fascinating country.
