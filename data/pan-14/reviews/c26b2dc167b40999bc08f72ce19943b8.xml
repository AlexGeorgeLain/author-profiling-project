Both were 3/4 days and last time was back in 2002.I am pleased to say that this hotel is every bit as impressive now as it was 5 years ago. Both times I have stayed with my wife and 2 children (in 2 rooms) and on neither occasion have any of us had any reason to complain.The hotel is friendly, some rooms have kitchenette facilities which is very handy for families, they are visited daily by the maid and kept very clean, the prices are reasonable and you can use the internet in the lobby for free-no questions asked.It is a little out of the centre of town but only a walk of 20 mins or so and its literally one minute to the underground. If you are a family looking for a nice quiet place close to the town centre, you are unlikely to do better than the Silevr Aparthotel.
