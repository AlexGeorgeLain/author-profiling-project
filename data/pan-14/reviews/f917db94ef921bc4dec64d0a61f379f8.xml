The room was clean, comfortable and well-equipped. The hotel had a nice lobby/lounge with free tea and coffee all day.The staff were excellent - really friendly and helpful. The food was out of this world; the hotel restaurant El Cortes is Michelin-starred but it wasn't expensive and it had a lovely atmosphere. They do a very reasonably priced Continental breakfast buffet. We would definitely stay here again.
