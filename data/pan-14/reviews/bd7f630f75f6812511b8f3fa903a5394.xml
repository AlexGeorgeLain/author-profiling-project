The staff couldn't be more helpful, as was seen from all the positive comments in the visitors book on leaving.I was a little worried about the proximity of the hotel to a main road (Via Cavour) on arriving, but all the rooms are at the the back and very quiet. You open the windows on waking up, and all you can hear is the sound of swifts flying around (well, at least until the workmen start on the ongoing renovation on the 2nd floor around 8am - which was OK)!The location of the hotel is absolutely brilliant, just a few minutes from the Duomo, so close to pretty much anything you want to see in central Florence.The corridors and main rooms have been very attractively done, and give the hotel a great ambience character. Miriam the receptionist was more than happy to pre-book tickets and reserve tables even before we arrived in Italy so that we did not even have to engage our brains but could just kick back and enjoy our trip without the hassle.
