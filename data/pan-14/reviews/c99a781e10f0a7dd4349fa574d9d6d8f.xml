Yeah!), the staff was great, and the location is excellent! The bar was small but very chic in decor, as were all common areas and our room. Definitely NOT the stereotypical colonial Boston look, but very modern, yet always comfortable feeling. The friendly desk staff offered us umbrellas one night when it looked like rain, was always ready with restaurant suggestions and directions, and the housekeeping staff was very quick with extra mugs, coffee, towels. The city was in the middle of a record breaking heat/humid spell when we were there, but the hotel's air-conditioning was always up to the task, and easily adjustable in our room. Black-out shade at the window was welcome and mattresses were so comfortable. Have stayed at Lenox and Park Plaza and this was so much nicer. Definitely hope I get to Boston and this hotel again!
