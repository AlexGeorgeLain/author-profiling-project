The hotel itself is older, as are most in NO; but, it was obviously totally refurbished and has all new furnishings. It is was known as a boutique hotel. Its about 5 blocks to Bourbon St and another 2 more to Decatur. The weather was great, so the walk was okay. They have no restaurant or breakfast facilities. Most restaurants are about 2 blocks away.
