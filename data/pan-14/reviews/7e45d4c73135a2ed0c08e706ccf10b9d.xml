Amsterdam is a very expensive city when it comes to accomodation. Ibis can be found for breakfast included and that is a good deal for Amsterdam. Yes, the bathrooms are small, yes it may e a bit on the noisy side but I can tell you two things...if you are in Amsterdam you don't want to spend your time in the bathroom except when nature calls, and the second thing is if you want peace and quiet go to Santorini in November and not Amsterdam! Enjoy it!
