Shame that Silvermine Resort just don't match all this beauty level.First of all - to reach any destination on Lantau island by taxi from HK Airport is relatively fast pleasant but only light-blue taxis are allowed within the island so ask taxis reception stand clerk at airport taxis parking to call for light-blue car as they are very few and you even don't spot any at taxis parking - only red green ones (prohibited to go to Lantau).Hotel located on bay beach which is quite small almost no space for bathing. The building rooms are dreadfully shabby outdated, you don't feel any relaxing vacation pleasure from this place. Sincerely I was a beat shocked how worn-out low-key it was. I've read reviews on this site before my holidays but they don't reflect all the reality unfortunately. It's better not to behave as total miser, spend $20 more per night have nice modern accommodation somewhere on HK island - it's not so awfully overcrowded or noisy or something as you may think before visiting HK.Breakfast is not edible, disappointing.However staff in Silvermine is trying noticeably to improve your feelings, they are very helpful friendly.
