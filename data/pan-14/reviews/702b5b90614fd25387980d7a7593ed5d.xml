The airport shuttle service and drivers were excellent and the room was much better than expected. Desk staff were courteous and friendly, hotel was quiet and the room was very clean. Complimentary continental breakfast was tasty (waffle maker !!) and (free) wireless internet access for my laptop was appreciated. Only drawback to Free computer access in lobby was that inkjet printer was out of ink so couldn't print boarding passes. Front desk explained that it was a contracted service to the hotel and couldn't do anything about it. Suggest upgrading to laserjet printer and having spare cartridges on hand. Overall, an excellent restful stay that kicked off our Florida vacation perfectly. Also a pet-friendly hotel, always appreciated since we often travel with our dog. Would definately stay again for any SeaTac early departure or late arrival.
