The price is amazing compared to many other places in L.A and the location is great as well. This was the only part of Hollywood that I felt comfortable in. Plus the free parking made it easier to have a car - because you need a car if you want to see everything in L.A. Its much faster, easier, cheaper, and safer if you just rent a car.- Even though the rooms are outdated style wise, they are still clean and large. The staff was helpful and friendly. One thing you have to remember is that this is a budget hotel, probably like a 2 star. So there are no extras and nothing is fancy. But it is still great value and I would definetly recommend it everyone.
