This was our first trip to NYC and was to celebrate our wedding anniversary.The staff is very helpful. The location is very central with easy access to Broadway and Grand Central Station. From there, you can get virtually anywhere.The rooms, as I expected, were small, but well kept. The property is quiet and it sometimes feels as though we were the only guests on our floor. The complimentary breakfast and evening wine and cheese are nice perks. We attempted to take in the garden terrace twice, but it was full both times. For those of you looking forward to this, be aware that it is open to both hotel guests, but also the general public....therefore, very crowded.Now, for the small negative. I notified the hotel when making the reservations and while at the property that Saturday was our anniversary. Nothing was done. I can only chalk this up to an oversight, but it was disappointing nevertheless.
