Our stay at the Hotel Pendini was fabulous. On the fourth floor of the arch in the Piazza Republica, the hotel is centrally located, walking distance to all the sites that the city has to offer. The rooms are reasonably priced, clean and comfortable, and the staff of the Pendini is fantastic. We were served by Barbara, Pamela, and a crew of helpful folks whose names we didn't learn. Their restaurant recommendations and reservations were first class. We've enjoyed the Pendini's hospitality in the past and will certainly stay with them on future visits to Firenze.Bernard Bette GoldsteinSaint Helena, CA
