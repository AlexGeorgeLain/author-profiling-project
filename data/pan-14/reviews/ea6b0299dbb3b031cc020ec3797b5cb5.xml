The additional expense was money well spent and we had lots of time watching the traffic in the harbour as well as enjoyed the views on Hong Kong side.Room was very good although some furniture looked a little tired.The hotel is well sited with shops and restaurants all around and we enjoyed time in the Kowloon Park - a secluded oasis in this hectic city about 15 minutes walk away.Roof top pool was smaller than I had hoped but I enjoyed the swim and staff were very helpful.
