The staff is so warm and friendly -- they really make you feel like family. They made our museum reservations ahead of time -- that is a must for the Uffizi Gallery. We saw the poor souls standing in 2 hour lines and we walked right in. The breakfast was excellent; be sure take up the offer of a cappuccino instead of just a coffee. It was delicious. The room was comfortable although not large and the price made it worthwhile. The location is great -- a couple of blocks from the nice shopping streets and about a block from the Duomo. Also, very near the San Lorenzo outdoor flea market where we picked up some tee-shirts at bargain prices.
