Some of the restaurants are housed in a large building which lacks intimacy and atmosphere. One evening I dined with a trolley stacked with dirty plates in view and by 10pm they were setting out the breakfast things. The French restaurant is the best for a classy dining experience but you usually have to pick up a bleeper and wait for a considerable length of time to get in. The lobster restaurant was OK but not fantastic and the Asian eaterie was disappointing.It's a shame because it's a fab place and while the dining experience was better than average, it wasn't to be raved about to friends afterwards. We did the Excellence Club which wasn't really worth the extra cash. Having your whirlpool bath run for you with bubbles and petals was, however, a delight but not worth the extra few hundred pounds! We'd go back because it's pretty good value and definitely an upmarket all inclusive, adults-only resort.
