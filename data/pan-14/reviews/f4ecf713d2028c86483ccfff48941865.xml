We checked in after a flight from Phoenix and the clerk was complaining that she had too much money in the drawer and if she was audited by the sheriff, she would be in big trouble cuz we don't want to get robbed. WHAT? That should have been my first clue to RUN! We get to our room and it had to be 90 degrees since the heater was on! We shut it down and turned on the AC to cool it off. Gross.Bed was like sleeping on plywood. When we left in the morning, we noticed the room across from ours had been bolted shut with L brackets. This must have been where the filmed the movie Vacancy.Spend more cash and stay at the Ramada next door...at least it looks better!I also complained to their Customer Relations department and am awaiting a reply!
