Can't think of anything the supermarket didn't sell, apart from proper baked beans, but then you can never get them in the states!We ate at The Keg, both the steak the salmon was delicious. We also tried The Bamboo Club - a wide variety of asian dishes on offer. Did not eat at the JW but Roy's looked superb.Very,very hot the entire week but you know before you go so be prepared. Will not be returning - there are too many places out there still to visit, but would recommend both the MCV Arizona.
