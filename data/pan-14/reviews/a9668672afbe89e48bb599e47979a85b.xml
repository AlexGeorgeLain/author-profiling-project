The hotel is a long way from LAX and will run you around a $50 taxi fare. Check in was quick and efficient. Was assigned room 623 which was much smaller than the pictures on the property web site, but still very nice and clean. View was of the Hollywood hills with some of the interesting homes perched on the cliffs. Also in view was the back alley with various homeless rummaging through dumpsters, drug deals going down, and ladies of the night parading back and forth. Ordered room service several times and while service was quick, the quality was lacking. One evening ordered a filet from their upscale Twist room service menu and what was delivered turned out to be what I would call two small minute steaks, definitely not a filet. The near area around the hotel certainly doesn't live up the the glamor image of Hollywood that is often portrayed. The attached mall is strangely designed and difficult to find your way around in. The area in front of the Chinese theatre is jammed with tourists and people hawking tours. Walk outside this area in any direction and you will encounter boarded up shops, cracked sidewalks, cheap souvenier stands, and numerous homeless folks. Of course, this is not the hotel's fault, but rhe area definitely detracts from the otherwise fine features of this hotel property.
