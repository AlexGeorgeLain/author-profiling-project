The staff are amazing and very friendly at all times. Great location and views. The decor is plush and well managed. The porters are extremely knowledgable and know absolutely anything about Singarpore. The breakfast buffet is is to die for, it gotg me out of bed every day!The in room entertaintment is hi tech all cables are supplied for connecting laptops, camera, DVD etc so it can be projected to the TV and the accompanying Bose speakers, well what can I say?I would recomend for any one!
