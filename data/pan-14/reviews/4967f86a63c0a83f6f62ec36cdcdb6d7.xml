It's conveniently located near the Plaza de Catalunya and the Ramblas, but in a more commercial, less touristy, and less noisy direction. The staff at the front desk consistently spoke English(definitely NOT a given in Spain, even in relatively expensive hotels) and were helpful, if not effusive. The interior decor gives the hotel a distinctive and welcome personality. Yes, you do feel a slight rumble from the subway underground on occasion, but I didn't find it bothersome.
