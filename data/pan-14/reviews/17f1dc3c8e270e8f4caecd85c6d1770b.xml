		<document id="e1c153cced06f5fafdd9318bc979892f" url=""><![CDATA[Good Value Much better than I thought it would be. Clean rooms, helpful desk people, adequate bathroom, free parking is a good thing in SF. Leave your car there and take the bus or cabs to where you want to go. Rooms in the back were ok but those in our party who stayed on the street side said it was very noisy.

		<document id="4350cd757dc22c9cd03b11874245f983" url=""><![CDATA[Great Value and Location We had a rate of $70USD and stayed six nights. One block from the beach and at the corner of the BUS stop - Great bus system in Oahu - go anywhere (Hanauma Bay not to be missed). Changed rooms from the north (Kuhio) side to the south due to noisy bus and truck traffic on the main street. Other than that it was a good clean room with all the amenities you need. A bit small but that did not matter at all. Would definitely go back if we got close to those rates again.
