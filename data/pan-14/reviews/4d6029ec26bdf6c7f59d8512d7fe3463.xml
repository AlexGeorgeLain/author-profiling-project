The pictures on trip advisor are very accurate so when you arrive, it feels like you've been there. Also, the location is superb and is close to all the sites. Very clean with nice wood floors and the staff is pleasant and helpful. Overall, highly recommended.

Being located on the southern part of Herengracht, it is close to everything. So, this is defenitely a strong point for this hotel. As far as cleanliness and styling, this hotel gets good marks. The rooms have a modern business feel that isn't formulated like many large hotels. The lobby has a nice bar with complimentary cokes, water, juices, snacks, etc. Breakfast was especially enjoyable with a full menu and a chef to make omellets, pancakes, and the like. The customer service is very good for a 3* hotel although, one of the night clerks was somewhat overbearing when it came to getting a water from the mini bar. Definetly has more of a 5* feel than 3*. We got a nightly rate of 199 euros which I thought was very reasonable considering the location and amenities. A lot of people have knocked this hotel on the price but I don't think their complaints have much merit. All things considered such as location, service, and amenities, I highly recommend this hotel to small families, couples, and business traverlers alike.
