I and my husband stayed here for 5 nights during late May-early June.. it was at a great location in Back bay area (absolutely beautiful area) and near the Hynes convention centre which was where my conference was held.. We booked a room with 2 double beds (same price as a single double bed so we decided to go for a more spacious room) and it was spacious and clean.. the bathroom is quite small though.. but had pretty good water pressure.. however the wall was quite thin so if you have noisy neighbour (like we did), they will most likely keep you up all night... The hotel was close to several train stations (different line so quite convenient).. we didn't have to use the subway much because everything is in walking distance.. only caught twice when we were too tired to walk back after a freedom trail walk.. and to the South Station with our lugguages.. Definitely would stay here again.. very convenient.. but hopefully next time we will have a more quiet neightbour..
