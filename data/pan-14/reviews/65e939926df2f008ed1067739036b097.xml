A little expensive for my taste, but this was vacation and for the hotel class and convenience not badly priced - $220 for 3 people. Very, very comfortable beds and pillows, excellent linens. Clean modern room though a bit small. Safe and secure premises. Free airport shuttle, even at midnight. Friendly efficient staff.Did not like: paying for internet, too little coffee in the room, no continental breakfast.
