Location is an easy walk to wherever you wish to go. Currently there is nothing to see or do around the hotel so it's very quiet. Others have written hotel descriptions with which we agree. This is not a large hotel but has plenty of rooms, good breakfast items and is very clean! Price is very reasonable at least this time of year, under $100 per night. Since I am claustrophopic, I was concerned about a comment someone else had, but I had no problem. Our King bed was in a space about 175 sq ft (small) and had a nice, large bathroom and closet on the otherside of a 3/4 wall. This is a charming place.
