It is in a great location, about 12 mins on metro from Las Ramblas, then maybe about a 7 mins walk from nearest metro (selva de mar) to the hotel. The room was great, comfiest bed ever, and the much needed aircon was a life saver. Bathroom massive. It is ideal if you are looking for more of a beach hol which we were. The beach is literally across the street and what a lovely beach it is. There are wee beach shacks all along selling food and drink and dj's every weekend til 3/4 in the am, lots of locals partying hard! We bought the multi-trip metro tickets and found these cheap and easy to use. There is a great shopping centre (Diagonal Mar) 5 mins from hotel,loads of eating places in the shopping centre too. There are about 4 chinese restaurants near the hotel, only one of which I would recommend. As you leave the hotel turn left and it is about 3 blocks down. Cheap as chips!!! Although they don't sell them!! The Chinese and Indian restaurants are defintely the cheapest in town.. Olympic Port is about a half hour walk away, down at the harbour, with loads of tavernas and pubs and a couple of discos. A couple of bars have bands in til 3am. But be warned take plenty cash cos it's not cheap there. If you're not prepared to walk back to hotel don't leave it too late to get a taxi, there's no chance after about 1.30 or 2am. We walked back a few times!! All in all I would say if you are going for a short trip then you would probably be better off nearer Las Ramblas but for a longer holiday it's a great hotel for access to the beach for lazy days and to the metro for sightseeing and shopping! Enjoy!
