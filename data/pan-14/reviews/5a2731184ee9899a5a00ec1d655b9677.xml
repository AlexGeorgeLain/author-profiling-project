After reading other reviews on this site I got myself a Priviledge card and scored 3 free glasses of champagne and a late 4pm check out. Although the room wasn't ready for our arrival (hence the 1 x extra free champagne) they were quick in getting it sorted (took 30 minutes whilst we supped in the bar). Room was gorgeous, bed comfortable but the bathroom was a lot smaller then I thought it would be. The room smelt amazing.A free bottle of champagne and glasses were waiting for us along with a birthday card when we arrived back later that night.Although concierges looked really overworked they managed to book restaurants and airport transfers for us, plus the doormen were really nice and up for a chat!Only thing was that we paid extra for a city view room (we got a view of Empire State straight out the window and the Chrysler building if you looked at a tight angle) I'm not sure it was really worth it. We were also in the room next to the stairs and ice machine which occasionally woke us up in the night. Overall fantastic and would stay here again.
