We had a clean room facing the inner courtyard which was quiet at night. The room was painted white with white voiles and blinds, a yellow leather armchair, and a bathroom with a shower and a stainless steel sink set into a bright orange worktop. A couple of large lithographs were the only decoration. The only downside to the room was the lack of adequate storage space - a small wardrobe and a shelf, but no drawers. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Breakfasts were superb - the dining room is set in an attractive glass-roofed atrium with leather chairs. A large choice of cooked breakfasts, smoked salmon, patisserie, cereals, yoghourts, fresh fruit salad with strawberries, coffee and teas etc. This provided an excellent start to the day. The cost for this is extra but, considering the choice and quality, it was good value for money.In addition, the hotel is very close to a U-bahn stop on one side and a pretty canal (an offshoot of the Spree) on the other. I would be happy to stay here again.
