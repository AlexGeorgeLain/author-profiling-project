The staff will happily watch you unload your car and struggle through the lobby with your suitcases. I think this place has been recently upgraded but my room was just tatty, a modern carpet and funky paint doesn't hide that the fittings in this place are early 80's maybe? Its just ok if you need somewhere to sleep.

I have to say following the reviews on here I was expecting a lot worse. I was pleasantly surprised. All staff were impeccably polite helpful. Starwood have there hands on this place, the beds were indeed heavenly, so comfortable I didn't want to get out of them. Great meeting spaces and glorious lounge. I tried the iron test, it took three calls to coach room service into bringing an iron which made me late for an important drinks reception, but that's my only negative point.
