The Grand Palladium Bavaro Resort was great. We stayed from March 20th to April 3rd Spring Break of 2008. The beach was paradise. Just warning everybody that there are a lot of topless women at the beach/pool. The food was good especially the seafood japenese a la carte. One thing you should know is to get chairs early in the morning if you want a spot. The disco was awesome a great way to meet new people. Everything was fine up until my last night when someone stole my camera.. it was horrible. If anyone knows anything about my lost camera please email surfer_babii@hotmail.com, it was a silver nikon coolpix camera on the side it was a bit damaged from being dropped. All i want is the pictures! Other than that, the resort was very nice.
