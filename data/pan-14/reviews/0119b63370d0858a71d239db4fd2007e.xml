However , as usual , you get what you pay for .All the hotel staff from the General Manager ( yes he is easily available ) downward are extremely friendly , welcoming and eager to please .There are hawkers on the beach but they also have the Balinese gift of a warm smile and friendly disposition .The guests are cosmopolitan with no rowdiness and a genteel air of luxury and laziness prevails .The hotel , in summary , satisfied all of our holiday wishes .
