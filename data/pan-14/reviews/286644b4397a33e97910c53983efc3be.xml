Me and a friend of mine stayed in this hotel during July 07 and it isn't as bad as some make out.When we told the receptionist that we had reservation, she offered an apartment for free, so we accepted. The apartment was a 2 minute walk round the corner and was like some sort of youth hostel, so we asked for a room back in the hotel and they did it, but there was a couple there whose luggage was robbed whilst they were waiting to check in.We used the free safes in the room to prevent any theft and the hotel was clean and comfortable and quite central.I can see why some people have had bad experiences though.
