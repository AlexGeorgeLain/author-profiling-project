Usually 1 hours for 8.000 rupiahs (US$0.80). the food from the hotel is great. i order a caramel mango for dessert and OMG you need to try that. they have a good pasta too. I pretty much just stay in the hotel and eat the hotel food. i went to Bali more than 3 times and i think it's great place to stay......
