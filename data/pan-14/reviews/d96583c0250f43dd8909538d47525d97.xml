Staff was very friendly but the personal touch was missing. The room was ok nothing very special. The Clubfloor lounge is very large and serves very good snacks. The Chinese Restaurant on the 5th floor has excellent food and service is above expectations.The Bar was a bit disappointing.Overall the Hotel is a little bit below what you would expect from a Mandarin Oriental in Asia. I have been staying in the Ritz-Carlton which is next door and has more spirit to it, so the next time I will prefer staying there.
