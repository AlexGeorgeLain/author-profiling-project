It's within a minute walk to the beach and the main shopping areas. The hotel and the rooms were nicely decorated. It's described as chic in one of the advertisements in the elevators and I agree that it is. The rooms were clean and I had no problems or issues with the service I received from the staff. In fact, every morning the housekeeper would take the time to say good morning to me when I passed her on my way to the elevators. The exercise room is small and the pool is not olympic, but it's not that small that you can't do laps (but it is 3 to 4 ft deep). Overall, I would definitely stay at the Waikiki Parc Hotel again and I would highly recommend this hotel to people who want to stay close to the beach and the main shopping areas.
