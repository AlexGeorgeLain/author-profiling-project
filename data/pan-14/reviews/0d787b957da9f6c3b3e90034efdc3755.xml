As we left the bus, various ANA staffers took our bags, ushered us to reservations and helped us to our rooms. No tipping necessary. The ANA staff offers service the likes of which most 5 star American Hotels can only aspire to. The staff tries to anticipate your needs and respond accordingly. We also stayed at the ANA in Kyoto. Another great experience. You will not be disappointed by the rooms, service or staff. Price was a value compared to most costs in Japan.
