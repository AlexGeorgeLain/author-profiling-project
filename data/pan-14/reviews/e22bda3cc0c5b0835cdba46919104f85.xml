The location was excellent and the beds were extremely comfortable, which was great as we were dealing with jet lag at the time.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind a budget place, but don't be fooled by the hotels website.

It was not very nice at all. facilities were poor and the room wasnt too clean.
