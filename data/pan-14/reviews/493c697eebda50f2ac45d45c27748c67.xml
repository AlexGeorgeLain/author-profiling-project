Make sure you take a good amount of time to enjoy all the aspects of the resort (animals, art, etc.). This place is great if you're looking for a really relaxing environment. There are many people at the resort, but there is so many places that it never gets crowded (except the elevators maybe). The pool was never crowded (if it is...you always have the beach). They had live music playing in some places at night. It was great to get a chance to sit down and listen to the band play Free Bird!There are so many wonderful things going on at the resort that you really must make sure you have time to just sit back and relax.My only complaints are that the pool closes too early (5:30pm) and some of the hotel attendents (especially around the pool) were not too helpful.
