When I booked with Hotwire, I knew that this was a brand new hotel in a location in Boston that was a little unfamiliar to me. It turned out to be close to everything-the North End, Quincy Market and the Common. The subway (South Station)is a block away which made it very convenient as we were traveling by the T only. The hotel was luxurious and the room spacious and beautiful. The bathroom was large and elegant. The staff was professional and very helpful. The one downside is that we would not have been able to stay there if I had booked with the hotel directly because the rooms are quite expensive. Overall, it was a pleasant stay in a great area overlooking Boston Harbor.

Quality restaurants are nearby also. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very clean and the bed comfortable. Great place to stay if your have someone at Mass General Hospital- it is a block away. I will stay there again on my next trip to Boston!
