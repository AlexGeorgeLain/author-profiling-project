Close to transport links including both Back Bay station (fifteen minutes walk) and the subway (Symphony is the closest stop and about five minutes walk), this hotel is great if you're looking to save money and see all Boston has to offer.The only disadvantage is that there was no restaurant when we were there, so sadly the convenience of BB was out, but it does benefit from being close to several restaurants and a mall, which all serve great breakfasts! Plus, a twenty minute walk takes you in the direction of the main shopping area and the common which has a lot of choice.The rooms are clean and decent sized and the staff on reception were friendly. If you want something wallet-friendly then I'd give this a shot- don't expect luxury but it certainly is quality.

We booked this hotel for a city break through the 'Euro Star' website and what a bargain it proved to be! The location is ideal in terms of access to the subway and walking in the local area, and the hotel itself was charming and very clean. The staff were very helpful too and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a city break in Paris as it is great value, close to amenities and the continental breakfasts were great- particularly the croissants! Yum!
