Great location obviously to the conv. center, as well as, the attached mall. Located really in the heart of the city so, easy to get anywhere. I thought that the public space was very nice and I used the free internet in the lobby (like a laptop lane). I thought the rooms looked a little dated.

The hotel looks a little different in person than on their new website, however it was still an OK property. Rooms are on the smaller side, however clean and bathroom was nice size. Walls are pretty thin, as the last night we were there, we had people check in next door and could here everything they were saying and could even listen to the music on their radio pretty clearly.Location was fine. Little grocery mart and restaurants in walking distance.Breakast was a little slim but, adequate none the less.
