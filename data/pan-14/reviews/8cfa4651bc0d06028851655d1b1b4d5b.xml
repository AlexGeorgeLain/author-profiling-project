They treated us as if we were in a first class hotel. The room was huge and pleasant with kitchen. The breakfast by the pool was really a delight. Wi-Fi easy! Location is central near Hollywood Blvd. for the Chinese theater, Kodak theater. They drove us to the restaurant at the top of the hill and picked us up after dinner!
