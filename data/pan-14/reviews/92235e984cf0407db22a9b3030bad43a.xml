It is over sized and makes you feel like you are in Las Vegas (not the good parts), the lift system means long waits and they are often full when they do arrive. The corridors were dirty with bags of rubbish and laundry left for more than 5 hours on most days. Having paid $500+ a night, the view was poor from the room and the window small, the bathroom in poor condition. Some of the staff were excellent thankfully but overall this is not someone I would stay. If you don't stay in many hotels this will be fine, but a seasoned travel will find this place nothing less than annoying and disappointing.
