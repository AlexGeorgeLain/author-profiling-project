Since we were travelling in Aug. air conditioning was important for us, and it was very good. However we were disappointed that the safe, another requirement of ours, was not electronic and we had to pay 4 Euros a day for the lock. The hotel is very large in an impressive but again, somewhat worn building, and so sometimes waiting for the elevator was a chore and we took the stairs. One of the staff members was very helpful in confirming our ongoing flight, another wasn't. The brunch was very nice. The location was excellent in terms of getting anyplace we wanted to go--we're enthusiastic tourists. But the hotel fronts on the Avenida which in Aug. is packed with people, to the extent that our taxi couldn't turn onto it when we arrived and instead we had to walk 1/2 a block. Leaving at 5:45 AM this was no problem. Personally I didn't like the crowds, either on the Avenida or on the Ramblas but others might not mind them, and of course, in other months they might be less dense.
