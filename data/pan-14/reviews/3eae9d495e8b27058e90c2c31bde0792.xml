It is right in the main square; like many other reviews have stated. The main issue with this hotel are the prices from the rooms, to the drinks and food. Everything is extremely expensive. Let me add as other reviewers have that the rooms aren't spectacular either. They are pretty average and the larger ones are too expensive to justify the price. My husband and I got a great deal from a friend of ours that assisted us with the booking. We wouldn't have stayed at this hotel and paid the regular rates unless there was more amentities in the room. Also, when we were having dinner at the hotel restaurant, the waiter spilled my husband's drink all over me on accident. Since I was soaked and didn't complain much, we thought they would take the drink and/or service charge off the bill; they didn't. So that told me they are not always aimed for great service but money is what matters most. Overall I would say only stay here if you can get a discount, if not, it is not worth the price.
