Before leaving home, we really wondered what we might have been letting ourselves in for but all our fears were unfounded. The hotel is an absolute gem and a real experience, There is not a space that isn't filled with ornaments, pictures, furniture etc, but there was not a speck of dust to be found. The bathrooms are tiny but spotlessly clean, although we did wonder how an overweight person would fit into the shower. A lot of thought has gone in to creating a warm, welcoming and really unusual place to stay. It is very centrally located and in a safe area. On a previous visit to Barcelona I stayed in the Gothic quarter and felt very nervous at night even though I was with my husband. Here we felt quite safe being out after dark. Abel and Sergio were so helpful, they are better than the tourist information office. They gave us maps and directions and recommended wonderful places to eat. I do second a previous review extolling the virtues of the Ciutat Comtal tapas restaurant. The only problem my friend had, was that her room was close to the reception desk and the guy who is on duty at night snores really loudly. I even heard him snoring one night from my room. I did urge her to mention this to Abel and Sergio but she didn't want to make a fuss so it is her own fault ,as I'm sure they would have changed her roomAll in all we really enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different. If we go back to Barcelona we will definitely return to L'Antic Espai and also to Ciutat Comtal. Thank you Abel and Sergio
