I cannot fault the hotel in anyway, from the moment we arrived we were welcomed by a very pleasent door man. We took the lift to the reception on the 20th floor, where we checked in. The staff on the desk were very polite and upgraded us to a king room on the 41st floor with views of the Empire State building which was excellent.The room itself was clean and comfortable with a plasma tv and loads of space. The location was perfect as we were close to all the things we wanted to visit and see. Just off Times Square where we were able to pick up the Grayline tour bus for the Downtown loop, the port Authority was half a block away, which was handy when we arrived back from Woodbury Common weighed down with bags. Macy's and Central Park where only 5/10 mins walk away as was 5th avenue and just to the left of the 42nd street entrance there was a subway station that connected with most parts of the city conveniently.I will definately stay at this hotel on my next trip to New York as we had a great experience here. And I would highly recommend it to anyone who wanted a central good standard hotel.
