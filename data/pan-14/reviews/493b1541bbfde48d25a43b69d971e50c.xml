Although we had some concerns because of some reviews at the end we were really satisfied that we stayed there. It was a great value of money !! The breakfast wonderfull, the staff very polite and friendly, the location perfect, and the rooms clean and cozy. The only negative I must underline is that for 5 nights we stayed our bed sheets were not changed. That was a disapointment but all the rest were really great.
