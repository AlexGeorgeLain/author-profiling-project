I would recommend it to anyone, but...The location is good news and bad news....Good news is that it is located right on the Piazza Signoria 50 yards from the Uffizzi and Palazzo Vecchio and a couple of blocks from the Ponte Vecchio and Dumo...what a great location !!Bad news...it's located right on the Piazza...Italians (and everyone else for that matter) don't appear to go to bed at all...there were people wandering and talking and laughing all night. That would have not been too bad except that we needed to have the windows open because it was warm and the AC doesn't get turned on until June...so basically we didn't sleep too well...When the windows were closed it was great, the renovation and new windows cut the sound perfectly...but when they were open...That is the only bad thing I can say...if you want a hotel with a fancy lobby and a concierge then this isn't the place for you, but if you want to be right in the middle of it all, this is the place !!
