Although there was no view, our room was well appointed and clean. Staff was friendly and service was above average. Service technician replaced our television set becuase it was not working. Location, in the financial district, was good even though rather dead on Sunday and Memorial Day. Close to the Embarcadero and ferry building where restraunts were open on Sunday afternoon. We would stay here again on another trip to San Francisco.
