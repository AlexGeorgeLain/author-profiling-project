The studio appartment had just been renovated so everything was new. Looked out over the back, with a tiny balcony and small view of the city but therefore very quiet. Staff could not have been more helpful. I think they are having some problems with some of the rooms as they gradually renovate, but we certainly have no complaints! Very close to everything.
