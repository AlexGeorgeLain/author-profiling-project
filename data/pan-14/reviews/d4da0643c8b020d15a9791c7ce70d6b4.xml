We explained to the reception staff about our 24 hour flight, and they were very understanding and were able to get our room ready 2 hours before the official check in.The hotel is very close to a busy couple of fly overs, so close you can wave at the drivers over breakfast! Even so there are 3 walk ways to Darling Harbor, less then 5 minutes away.Darling Harbor is a great place for tourists, many restaurants, shops and bars. We had the best steaks at the meat and wine co, just by the IMAX. Chinta Ria is a nice chiense and the there are a lot of seafood restaurants around. The take away fish and chips at ice cube restaurant (also by the IMAX) are best eaten on the wooden steps round the bottom of the harbor watching life go by!Back to the hotel, the staff were all very friendly, always tried to do what they could to make our stay easier, the concieage team were fantastic.2 downsides that we found, the high cost of internet access and the cost of washing clothes. The hotel cost was well over but we found a little place to do a service wash across the road for just we ever visit sydney again, we will be staying at the crowne plaza.
