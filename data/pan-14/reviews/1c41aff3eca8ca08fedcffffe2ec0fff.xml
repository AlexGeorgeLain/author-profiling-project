My room was comfy, the housekeeping service was excellent. There was a business centre I could use for internet and printing etc, a nice little gym and overall the staff were always very helpful and accomodating. I had no problems whatsoever with this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who does not mind the nightlife noise from the neighbouring properties - I can sleep through anything and in any event, this was not some romantic getaway.
