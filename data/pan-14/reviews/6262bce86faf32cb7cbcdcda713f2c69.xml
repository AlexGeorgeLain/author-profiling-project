There were four of us, so I booked 2 rooms. There was very little difference between the two rooms. The rooms were well maintained, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was a pleasure, and the breakfast in the on site Ruth Chris's Steakhouse was excellent. I would definitely stay there again.

There were four in our party, so we booked two rooms. I have made many previous trips to London, and have stayed in BB's, Le Meridien, The Marriott, The Grosvenor House, and The Savoy. After this trip, there is no question where I will stay on my next trip. I will definitely return to The Chesterfield Mayfair. The service was the best that I have experienced in London, the food in the restaurant (Butler's) was wonderful, and even the tea in the Chesterfield Mayfair Conservatory was super. Their scones were much, much better than the famous scones served at The Wolseley. The only thing they could improve on would be the firm beds. I found them a bit too firm, and would rather have a softer pillowtop mattress. I did sleep well, so it was not a major problem.Reviewer from Benicia, CA
