Drinks were good. Wish the hotel had more activites but the beach was wonderful. We weren't fighting for chairs. The pool was good. The staff were friendly but not very many of them spoke English very well. Entertainment was good. This resort is more quiet than the other ones. Shopping is nearby. (Just around the corner). I would stay here again.Edmonton, Alberta
