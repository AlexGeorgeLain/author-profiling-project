I've been to this fabulous city several times, but have never been able to get a room at this hotel. Happily, my husband and I were fortunate enough to stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel for 5 nights at the beginning of this November. Our room, with a wonderful view of the canal, was charmingly furnished, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. We felt so at home, it was very difficult to leave. Breakfast brought to our room was the ultimate luxury; the fresh breads, croissants, cheeses, and coffee were the perfect start to every day. The location was great: off the beaten path, but within 5 - 10 minutes of multiple restaurants, shopping, museums, etc. Pierre and Gunter are perfect professionals. They were friendly and informative, but never intrusive. What more can I say about an establishment that loaned us an umbrella, an extension cord, and a flower vase? We would go back next week if we could, and certainly plan to stay there again sometime in the future.
