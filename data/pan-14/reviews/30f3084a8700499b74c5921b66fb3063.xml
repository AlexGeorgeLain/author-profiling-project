We were given a studio which faced to the west toward the park and downtown Honolulu. The unit was very comfortable and the staff was helpful and friendly.The hotel is about 3-4 blocks from the beach which took about 10 minutes to walk. They provide beach towels so you don't need to take your own. We obtained supplies from the ABC stores which are everywhere. We ate at the Shorebird in the Outrigger Reef hotel and at the Cheesecake Factory, which is about a half mile from the Luana. We did not rent a car and walked to the areas of interest or took the tours. We did a tour for the Pearl Harbor/Arizona Memorial.The stay was very good and would recommend it to anyone.
