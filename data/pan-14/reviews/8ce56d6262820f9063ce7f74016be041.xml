Rooms are great and cleaned spotlessly everyday. The staff are very friendly food and drinks at the pool good but a little expensive compared to other places but then this is a 4 star hotel. Lots of conference guests but this suited us as it meant the pool was very very quiet during the week. We went with our toddler who loved the big pool and toddler pool. Would love to go back although the walk into town got a bit boring if you did it more than once a day. Sitges is as lovely as ever. We stayed at the Calipolis 4 years ago which has a great location but may have been too noisy now we have our daughter. Would definately go back to the Melia.
