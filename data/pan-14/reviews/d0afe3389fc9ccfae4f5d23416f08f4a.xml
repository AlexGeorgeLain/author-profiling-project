H10 Itaca added a lot to the great experience we had in Barcelona. Yes, it's really excellent: the breakfast, the service, the rooms the bathrooms... Taking the train from the airport is worthwhile and the hotel is really only a 10 minutes walk (with trolley bags). In the hotel building is also a nice supermarket. Very handy for mineral water, fruits and snacks for your long city excursions. The subway (metro) is not far and neither are banks and a pharmacy if you need it.
