They were cheerful, polite and willing to help. Thanks to the concierge for locating my lost spectacles in a down town store even after we had left for another venue.Our intial room was not satisfactory due to it overlooking a road intersection on which there is a cable car stop, but this was promptly and pleasantly dealt with. We were offered an alternative immediately. Thanks Suzanne you were a star.The rooms are a good size clean and very, very comfortable, with complimentary coffee and tea making facilities.We used both the in hotel dining and room service. Hope you are not on a diet!!!!!! The meal from room service arrived on time and was nicely presented. The champagne Sunday brunch is a must, all you can eat and drink for $26 per person. Would definately stay again and recommend to friends
