I was with a group so I had to stay at this hotel but our group was quiet. The walls are made of paper you can hear the people on either side of you as if they were in your room. Also you can hear everyone's shower, bathroom ,tv blow dryer. Some of our group on the second floor had high school kids running up down the hall, drinking sitting on the steps until 3AM the hotel management would not do anything about it so you could imagine what that was like with the paper walls. The next complaint was at the Breakfast Dinner that was included. I don't expect much from the meals which were OK, it was one rather chubby waiter that served you that smelled so bad it made your eyes water he was there each time.I would avoid this hotel at all costs. Don't let the vicinity to the sights fool you or how it looks from the outside. I have stayed here 2 times each time it was like this, including the same smelly waiter. If I go on this tour again I will get a different hotel. If you do have to stay here, bring earplugs!!!!
