This was our second visit, and the reservations department had our file up and our preferences in place.I do wish that there was an additional place to eat breakfast or dinner on the grounds. The lines were longer than I expected, even with reservations.

Room 265 was a superior double which means low end of a double room. Room compact and decorated in dark olive green which made it seem even smaller. NIce bathroom but no stall shower. Beige carpeting had an unbelievable amount of dark stains like shoe polish smuges. Asked to have room changed; hotel wouldn't, as they claimed they were all booked up. I was told the carpeting would be cleaned the next day. THIS NEVER HAPPENED.The buffet breakfast, buffet lunch and set dinner menus were skimpy and not worthy of a deemed five star property. Public areas are five star as is the location. Room gets a three star at most, food gets a one star.
