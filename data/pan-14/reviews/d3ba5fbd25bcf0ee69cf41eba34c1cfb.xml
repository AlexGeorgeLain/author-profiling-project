We've paid far more gotten far less in NYC in our many trips there. The continental breakfast featured European-quality pastries and fabulous Italian coffee, far superior to the nearby Starbucks, and it was all included in the price of the room. Concierge James put us onto a neighborhood Italian restaurant, Vice Versa, where we had one of the best meals ever in NYC. We will be back to both!
