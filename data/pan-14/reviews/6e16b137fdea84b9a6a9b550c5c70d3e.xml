It is a great base from which to explore the city. The cable cars can be accessed directly across from the hotel. We loved the coziness (and cleanliness) of our room, the positive atmosphere, and friendly staff. We are so glad we did not stay down in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Thank you to everyone at the Chancellor for making our stay great!
