We stayed at the Hoxton for 3 nights at the end of July, and got one of their special low rate deals for one night, and the total package was for two people for three nights.Arrived in reception and were immediately advised that our room was going to be nearer the lifts as their was some building work further up the hotel which was fab, we were in a room that looked straight down over the court yard.We ate dinner and breakfast in the hotel once and could not fault it. The rooms were a little on the small size but had everything you need and I just loved it, the special little touches like fresh milk in the fridge and the pret-a-manger breakfast bag.An ideal base for exploring London, only 5 minutes from a tube stop, and although we had trouble getting back one night as we missed the last tube, and struggled for a taxi, we still had a great time in a lovely hotel!The staff were all really friendly and polite and full of information if you needed it...Would I stay again - definately!
