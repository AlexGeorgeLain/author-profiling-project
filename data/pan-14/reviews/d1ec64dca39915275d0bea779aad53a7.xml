It is just blocks from the Prudential Center, Newbury Street, and very short walk to two different T stops, (Prudential on green line, and Back Bay on Orange line). In a quiet neighborhood of beautiful brownstones and a walking path to that orange line stop, it is a very safe area. We were warmly greeted and treated well at check in. We had a studio in the building on Newton St, which was very quiet. The room was small, but very clean and we really enjoyed having a kitchen. There were many wonderful resturants nearby on Tremont St. and a huge grocery at the Prudential complex. My traveling companion and I thought that this was a great value and we would recommend this hotel to our friends and will stay there again when visiting Boston.
