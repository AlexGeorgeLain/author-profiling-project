The attitude from the employees seems to get worse and worse each time. You would think you were staying in a posh boutique hotel in SOHO. The hotel itself is nice and rooms are great, but beware of the hotel staff!

Room service was ok and there are only 4 English speaking channels on the TV and the rest do not come in because of bad recption. The rooms were nice and service was ok. What was good was the location. It is close to all the shopping on Orchard Rd. and there is plenty of things to do around the area. No spa in hotel, which was a disappointment. I would look for another hotel when I go back to Singapore.
