And the rooms were amazing. Even if you don't have a harbour view room (and it's a real shame if you don't) you can still take the lift up to the roof, to the pool, and see the great view from there.The buffet breakfast was superb as was their dinner menu. And guests of the hotel immediately get 30% off the menu in the hotel restaurant so it's really good value.I'd go back to this hotel in an instant!!!!
