		<document><![CDATA[@JPStarkiller201 Every media outlet "lies" on some level. Breitbart, Info Wars, Drudge Report and Prison Planet do the same thing.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unvarnishedvoid Do you not know how to spell? And there you were trying to insult my intelligence. Better luck next time, doll.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@unvarnishedvoid "Mass immigration causes crime increase." Because only migrants can be criminals?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EgglordDaNos4A2 Actually, like you, @unvarnishedvoid is hiding behind a fake name. So it'd be impossible to define his/her/its gender.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TwiSparkPhil @unvarnishedvoid What utter tripe.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unvarnishedvoid So you don't accept that pedophilia isn't based religion?]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Actually, that has nothing to do with Obama. Even though you think that it does.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@TwiSparkPhil You do realise that Trump was emotionally manipulating his supporters, yeah? Telling them exactly what they want to hear...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unvarnishedvoid Child rape and child grooming have happened in Europe LONG before the current refugee crisis. Nice try though! #Muppet]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unvarnishedvoid Your command of the English language is minimal and you're insulting MY intelligence? Oh okay. #Hypocrite]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@EveLaurence I think so. Someone said that "The sooner he goes the better." Then again, Ireland's PM is still going to the White House, so..]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He's gone too far. #StandUpToTrump]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@timthejarhead @KarenDoe50 There are other examples of people who need medical treatment being denied entry to the US though.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@AnthonyBuccill He said "Ban Muslims from the US until we figure out what the hell is going on!" during his campaign. The hell do you think?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@timthejarhead @KarenDoe50 https://t.co/8COWlNWWB6
As much as I normally don't like the Daily Mail, the story is absolutely sickening.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@unvarnishedvoid Jesus Christ. You don't have to be Muslim to be a pedophile. Unless you think that Fritzl was a Muslim!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 "and there's the proof that you don't follow the whole news."
That's a big claim coming from someone like you.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 You do realise that a lot of people who support Trump have no desire to better themselves? Read Hillbilly Elegy by @JDVance1.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarenDoe50 That's because you're a sociopath. By the way, a 1-year old child with cancer was just denied entry to the US. Good job! 👏👏👏👏👏]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@washingtonpost Imagine being so filled with hate that you would let innocent children die? This is insanity....]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Who says I'm "listening to CNN"? Why don't you stop trying to attack me because I don't exclusively follow right wing sites?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@KarenDoe50 "We? It's not up to you...lol." Funny. Seeing as someone flying to the US from Dublin airport was turned away today. Piss off.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 What limited resources? Unemployment is at 4.7%. There are more jobs in America than there were 8 years ago.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Are you serious? Trump plans to make things worse for everyone in the US. Repealing the ACA would deprive people of healthcare.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Say NO to the agenda of hatred that's currently peddled by @realDonaldTrump. We'll start by saying no to #Sessions]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Bullshit. Your lot are quite good at either creating problems from nothing or making a bad situation worse.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 We ARE taking in refugees. Don't think your lot is as familiar with the good that other countries are doing, I'm sorry to say.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 You do realise that Trump doesn't give a damn about any of the things you've listed? Repealing the ACA is but one example.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 So you're justifying it?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Did I say that? By the way, Ireland has done more than the US to help.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Trump's plan makes them all the same. Hence the "indefinite" freeze on admitting refugees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Look, if you demonise people then they'd (most likely) conform to those expectations. Like refugees.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 So, you'd exclude the ones who want to integrate into society too?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 "So called refugees"? The Paris attacks for example, were carried out by French nationals! Who just happened to be Muslims.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 You're advocating committing an illegal act on the assumption that all refugees would commit illegal acts. It's a slippery slope.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 There already WAS "vetting" in the US and elsewhere. All Trump has done is take it too far.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 So, you're going to be "Judge, Jury and Executioner?"]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Not all refugees are violent. In Ireland, for example, I'm far more likely to get attacked by another Irish national.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@NBCNews Wasn't Paul Ryan going to stand up to Trump? Or did his rat-like need for self preservation take over?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Trump thought that Obama didn't go far enough, so he took some incredibly unnecessary steps. That's not my fault.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 You said that you'd "kill to defend", not me.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Trump is the President now. And it was HIS decision, not Obama's.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Most refugees are interested in (and capable of) integrating and being part of society.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 The ban targets people from Muslim majority countries. Which is something that you haven't managed to understand.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Actually, you don't HAVE to be a refugee to rape and murder people. I'm sure you've "NEVER" done any of that.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 PEGIDA are anti-immigrant. Trump seems to have been watching a lot of Lutz Bachmann's speeches. In addition to Tommy Robinson's.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@politico How was Sessions able to say that with a straight face?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JPStarkiller201 Weren't you falsely accusing the left of throwing insults? #Hypocrite]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 @NBCNews Bissonnette's Facebook page. Also, white nationalism knows no borders. Like any other political ideology.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JPStarkiller201 So, trying to create multiple trade wars will create jobs? In what universe would that help?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JPStarkiller201 There are plenty of people on the far right who hurl insults at people. Really have no clue why you're virtue signalling!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@ChickenChaser I think that @BigJoe570 would probably not consider that as evidence.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Actually, white nationalism/supremacism is not unique to any one country. Ever heard of an organisation called PEGIDA?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 Hang on. Political ideologies know no geographical boundaries. There's plenty of Irish people who stupidly support Trump.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@sjslaxdaddy Most of the jobs Trump wanted to bring back were unskilled manufacturing jobs. The majority of which are now automated. #Mong]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BigJoe570 @NBCNews Ah yes, because you think Breitbart is unbiased?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@JPStarkiller201 Look up what the word "sociopath" means. Trump has most of those characteristics.]]></document>
