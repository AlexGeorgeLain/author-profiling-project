		<document><![CDATA[@Young_Baker911 @Jay_Blue24 I think they'd like to do something but can't will a player onto the market. As always, depends what's out there]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GirlWonder3 Will be interesting when he's back, I do think Norm has earned a role but I understand why they've managed it the way they have]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MR_Malice14 I think they feel VanVleet has earned the 3rd spot. Whether Delon is 100% or not, he probably has to re-earn their trust.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@GirlWonder3 Thats exactly how they've used Norm but tough to give him consistent role while also trying to get something out of Ross/DC]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@GirlWonder3 Because there are better players ahead of them. Cant change rotation every time someone has a bad night. Chemistry is important]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@moubarakyoussuf Whether you/we panic or not, won't change anything. This will be a very telling 3-week stretch for the organization]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@MR_Malice14 We'll see what happens but Id continue to ride hot hand at that position. If Joseph's not giving it to you FVV &amp; DW are capable]]></document>
