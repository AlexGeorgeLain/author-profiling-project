		<document><![CDATA[It's 1-1! Osasuna's lead didn't last five minutes &amp; it's madness by Mario. Comes for a long throw but doesn't get there; Camacho nods in.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Berizzo brought Radoja on to try to shore up the midfield after Jozabed had tired, but the team desperately lacked an outlet like Bongonda.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Pione Sisto, who's been very lively, nearly puts Celta ahead. They've settled well after a bright start from the hosts. #RealSociedadCelta]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@LaLigaGav Indeed we do. Berizzo called that match "life or death" but still feels his XI here is "strong &amp; competitive" #NotSureAboutThat]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Eusébio Sacristán will hope his side have the game wrapped up by then. Hopefully the game can live up to today's very high standard! #LaLiga]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[About to kick-off in Anoeta - two top teams competing for the European places. Celta, as expected, have heavily rotated. #RealSociedadCelta]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Paul_Morrissey agreed- spoilt for options, defending obviously an issue at times but again showed today they can score from any situation]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Imagine having the depth to bring on Correa, Kranevitter &amp; Sarabia. Vietto &amp; Kiyotake also on bench. Sampaoli's Sevilla keep on truckin'...]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Osasuna having the luck of a team at the bottom. Superior to Sevilla, as they were superior to Granada last week, but it's 1-1 at HT.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Osasuna need León to maintain scoring form if they're to have any chance of survival. Clearly their best attacker but so wasteful of late.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@LaLigaGav @Millar_Colin Other than Valencia I haven't seen much. Will still cost around 2-3 million, I'd've thought, which rules out a lot]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Millar_Colin Absolutely- Orellana would be an incredible addition of quality to the attack, &amp; at a snip. I imagine Rubén would be thrilled!]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DanielFMPro agreed, shame to see such talented players stagnating - in Espinoza's case he's been a victim of Alaves being very competitive]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@DanielFMPro Villarreal will likely loan Cristian Espinoza elsewhere now. Alaves will return him to free a non-EU place for Romero, I think]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Theo didn't seem too happy about that at all. He and Camarasa exchange heated words as they trudge off. A valiant effort from the away side.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Theo &amp; Manu Garcia were standing over it; ultimately the young left-back deferred to the club captain who fired straight at the wall. 1-0 FT]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Still goalless with 4 minutes + stoppage remaining. Alavés dangerous on the counter but Mallo nearly scored with a cross off the post.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Alavés doing a job on a tired Celta team. If anything, going down to 10 men has helped them - they've become more compact to break down.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Diego Lopez was a major doubt for today, and so far looks like he could have been rushed back too soon. Uncharacteristically nervy start.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Valencia well on top in the opening minutes - Soler has a shot cleared off the line after a spell of pressure. Good to see him start again.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Surely it's time Valencia won a game? The 17th-placed strugglers host Espanyol in the early kick-off. Diego Lopez back after injury. #LaLiga]]></document>
