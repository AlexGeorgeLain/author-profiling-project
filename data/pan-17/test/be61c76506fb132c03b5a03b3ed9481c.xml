		<document><![CDATA[@garrettkidney definitely, wonder if people would be interested in standalone films though given everything is a universe these days.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@garrettkidney it'll be interesting to see whether it limps on after WW &amp; JL or some sort of reboot down the line.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@garrettkidney they're all so unlikeable, just grim, cynical characters. The whole "dark and edgy" trend went out with Nolan's trilogy.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BenAffleck let me have the gig man, I'll even do it for half of whatever WB are paying.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@garrettkidney how Snyder kept his position (and even expanded it!) after MoS &amp; BvS is insane.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@garrettkidney it's head scratching how wrong they've got it at every turn so far. Tbf Warner Bros. are a mess in general a long time now.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[lol at some people trying to spin this into a positive for DC/WB, it's a disaster plain and simple.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Is there anyone genuinely surprised? If Justice League bombs I doubt Affleck will even stay on as the character. https://t.co/MgBSu8ZekA]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BohsJohnny never really checked out the promotion until recently, seems like good craic. And the tag league sounded great]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@BohsJohnny yeah I was looking forward to hearing Alan call it, hopefully FloSlam get some more shows uploaded soon.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[Same for Nakamura too. Hope this delivers as well as I've heard.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[He has everything down in NXT, just needs to produce another level of match consistently.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Roode looks a million dollars with this entrance.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Right on to Roode/Nakamura now. That video package for it was next level class.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Whats the deal with WXW's commentary btw? We've got one Daniel Bryan sounding motherfucker having a full on interview with himself.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle Can't wait for the meltdown online my friend.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle Taker can call it, doesn't necessarily have to physically lead things. The finish will be interesting.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle fair point, although he's in better shape than he was. All Taker needs to do is signature stuff, Reigns will do the rest.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle and if it's Taker last outing he'll do everything to make it worthwhile.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle tbf he hasn't had a great opponent since Punk, WM 30 was a write off too. Reigns always delivers in big matches.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle Wyatt will go in as champion.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@WrestleSubtitle I disagree both should deliver big time although I'd have rather it was Reigns/Strowman &amp; Taker/Cena.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[What a time to be alive, everything is so very bad but the wrestling...the wrestling is good.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I'd still probably go with Dunne/Bate or Hero/Sabre as my favourite of the month.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mayafacetico yeah I'd take Flair by for the first half but the latter wins might go with Cena. He's had some amazing defences.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Has anyone written anything yet comparing Cena &amp; Flair's respective 16 wins/reigns?]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Mayafacetico really gives them a big fight feel around the matches each time, essentially wrestling meets Star Wars.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Even the tweets I've seen like "It sucks, but I have to admit..." no mate it doesn't suck but thanks for recognising Big John as the GOAT.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[The best part was seeing the divided reaction when Cena came out to winning the whole place over at the end.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[I still can't get over how good Cena/Styles III* was. A great month of wrestling.

		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row , can't wait to see the reaction if Reigns does retire Taker at WM.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row not necessarily a bad way to go provided they go with the Reigns we saw last night]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row rn I reckon the potential Summerslam title match is Lesnar/Reigns.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row Not looking forward to going back to Dark Souls Boss Level Lesnar though.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row if it shakes up their main event scene or makes it exciting at least it's not all bad.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row suppose it gives a reason to make it the main event.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@Oli_Row apart from a potential Reigns/Strowman or Reigns/Taker match. Goldberg/Lesnar should've fun but I don't get why it needs the title.]]></document>

		<document><![CDATA[@glasgowkjh @allan_cheapshot tbf the star rating system escapes me in general.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[@glasgowkjh @allan_cheapshot can I ask why people keep the 3/4 part of the rating? Seems so small as to not really matter when rating stuff.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Facist Hulk Hogan. https://t.co/vzPfmtsWVn]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[Ok wait it was probably Cena's lariats or Harper turning on Wyatt tbh but still up there.]]></document>
